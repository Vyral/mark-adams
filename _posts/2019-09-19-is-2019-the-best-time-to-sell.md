Many sellers are wondering whether 2019 may be the best time to list their homes, and the truth is that it very well may be. Homes are selling quickly and for top dollar—with homes in good condition often earning more than asking price.&nbsp;

This is partially thanks to our interest rates, which, after dropping significantly since last year, have made buyers extremely eager to make a move.

However, these conditions won’t last forever. Home prices have been steadily on the rise since 2012, and they’re going to have to stabilize sometime. Experts say that time is drawing near.&nbsp;

The bottom line is that now is the time to act. We can’t be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.&nbsp;
