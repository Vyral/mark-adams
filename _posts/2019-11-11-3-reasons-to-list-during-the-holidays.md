I want to share three advantages to listing your home during the holidays:

**1\. Low inventory.** During this time of the year, inventory is especially low, and there are not many admirable homes on the market. Most people wait until the beginning of the year to list their home, so there’s less competition.&nbsp;

**2\. Motivated buyers.** We don’t have any “window shoppers” out right now—we have buyers.

**3\. Home presentation.** Your home never looks as nice as it does during the holidays. For example, my wife enjoys getting out the holiday decorations and making the house look incredible.

If you’re thinking about selling your house, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be glad to come by and see if it makes sense for you to list your home during the holidays. If you have any questions feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help you in any way I can\!<br>&nbsp;
