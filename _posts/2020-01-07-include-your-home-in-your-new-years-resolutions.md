Happy New Year\! **I hope the new year is starting out wonderfully for you.** You know about New Year’s resolutions, but have you ever considered including your home in them?&nbsp;

At the beginning of the year, my wife and I make a list of all the things we want to accomplish in or on our house that year. Everything from larger projects like adding a porch, to smaller things like painting a room. Typically, your home is the single largest investment you’ll make. Maintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell.&nbsp;

I receive calls from people frequently asking what’s the best improvement someone can make to get the highest return on investment. Generally, it’s kitchen and bathroom improvements. At the same time, **not all investments will bring the same return.** A fence, patio, or a shed, for example, are “use” items, which means you get to use them, but you don’t necessarily get a full return on that investment.

Here’s what I recommend: Once you decide which projects you want to do, write them down. Make sure this list is in a place where you’ll see it regularly. When you see this list on a regular basis, you’ll be more inclined to get those projects done. Also, studies show that writing something down helps you remember it better.&nbsp;

If you’re concerned about which projects you should do, give me a call or send me an email, I’d be glad to share which project will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Have a fantastic 2020\!
