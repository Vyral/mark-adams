What do women really want on Valentine’s Day? I brought together my favorite group of ladies: my team, Amy, Lisa, and Chloe. I’m going to ask them some questions, and their answers may enlighten you about what women want.&nbsp;

**Do your Valentine’s Day desires fall more in line with Hallmark or HGTV?**

* Chloe: Is the food network an option? As long as he’s cooking for me.
* Amy: I like a little romance, but I also like projects. So I would want a pot for cooking, chocolates, perfume, or jewelry.&nbsp;
* Lisa: For me it’s HGTV; I want those projects done. Make me something pretty.

**What’s the last thing you’d ever want on Valentine’s Day?**

* Chloe: I do not want another singing card\!
* Amy: Don’t buy me golf clubs; you can get me lessons, but not the actual clubs.
* Lisa: No fishing pole. I don’t want to go fishing, talk about fishing, or shop for fishing lures.&nbsp;

**What’s the perfect Valentine’s Day gift?**

* Lisa: Something with whiskers… meow.&nbsp;
* Chloe: I second that, but also pizza and champagne.&nbsp;
* Lisa: Or a day trip. Even just shopping and lunch in another town nearby would be great.
* Amy: My family wants another puppy, so that would be the perfect family gift. I would also be happy to cook dinner for everyone.

I want to thank my favorite ladies for gathering to share their thoughts about Valentine’s Day. I hope you learned something, I know I did. Have a happy Valentine’s Day\!&nbsp;
