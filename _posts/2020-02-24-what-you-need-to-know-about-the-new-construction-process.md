Amy “The Miracle Maker” Baker works a 50/50 split between new construction and resale homes. Since inventory is pretty slim, many are turning to new construction right now. Today she joins me to discuss why you need an experienced agent like her to help you navigate the new construction process.

**What are the differences between buying new construction and resale homes?**

In a new construction home, you get to choose the design, layout, and finishes that come in that home. With a resale home, you’re inheriting someone else’s home, including their landscaping and neighborhood.

**What are the pros and cons of buying new construction?**

The timeline for new construction can definitely be a downside; Amy has seen many delays in recent months, sometimes as long as three months\!

**&nbsp;What’s the difference between a production builder and a custom builder?**

Production builders are cost-conscious; they’ll provide you with a few lot selections, floor plans, and finish packages to choose from. This keeps prices down and buyers from getting overwhelmed by all the options they have.

Custom builders give you a lot more choice over how the house is designed like your flooring, paint colors, trim, hardware, etc., so they involve a bigger time commitment.

**What do people need to know about new construction purchases?**

When buyers walk into a new construction site, there’s usually a salesperson or site agent there. That agent represents the builder, not you, meaning that if you write that person an offer on the new construction home, they’ll be negotiating for the builder and against you. So if you sign your name into their registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.

That’s why you need to give agents like Amy a call before you begin shopping for homes; she’ll represent your best interests from the beginning to the end of the process.
