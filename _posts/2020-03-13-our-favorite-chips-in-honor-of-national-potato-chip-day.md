March 14 is National Pie Day and National Chip Day. Today we’re celebrating in advance.

Did you know that March 14 is National Potato Chip Day? **In honor of the occasion, I wanted to get together with my team to discuss some of our favorite salty, crispy, and crunchy treats.**

My favorite are the classic potato sticks. They’re crispy, salty, and delicious.

Chloe’s are Pringles, which bring back fond memories of her mom sending her care packages filled with Pringles every summer at camp.

Lisa brought Andy Capp Hot Fries, which she wasn’t introduced to until she met me. In addition to being crunch and crispy, they add a little bit of spice.

Annie brought a local treat, Mama Saba’s Pita Chips. They are a scrumptious, slightly healthier alternative to potato chips. She also brought Dorito’s, which she used to put on a sandwich with mayo and country ham when she was younger and in school.

**March 14 is also National Pie Day, and I got a close-up view of one at 3:30 in the video above.**
