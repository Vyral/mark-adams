<p style="text-align:center">I’m sharing our latest real estate market statistics.</p>

Yes, we’re all stuck at home, but happy spring anyway\! For the last few weeks, everyone has been asking what’s going on in our real estate market and where it’s heading. Many people are getting their information online or through the news, but the info we’re sharing comes directly from our Multiple Listing Service (MLS). As of the recording of this video, in the last three days, there were 209 new listings on the marketplace, 214 homes actually went under contract, and 141 closed. So right now, we’re in a seller’s market. To learn more about our market, watch the short video above.&nbsp;
