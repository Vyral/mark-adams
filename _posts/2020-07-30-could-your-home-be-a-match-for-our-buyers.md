*I’m digital door knocking to find homes for some of my buyers.*

Today I wanted to share a new opportunity with you that I call “Digital Door Knocking.” As I’m sure many of you are aware, we are experiencing a shortage of inventory in the market right now. In other words, there are not a lot of homes for sale.

I’m doing things a little bit differently by telling you about some of the buyers we are currently working with and what they are specifically looking for.

**First, we have this awesome couple with two kids who are looking in the Freeman school district.** They want a home with four bedrooms, under $400,000, and most importantly, an in-law suite.&nbsp;

Next, we have another couple who are first-time homebuyers with one child. They’re looking for a home in the Bellevue and/or Lakeside area with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and under $350,000.

Another couple we’re working with are empty nesters who are moving back to Richmond. Location is not as important to them as the home. **They’re looking for a contemporary house, and their budget is $1 million.**

Finally, we have an amazing family of four who are looking for a home with five acres or more in the Louisa, Goochland, Hanover area. They need to have a basement and their budget is under $500,000.

If you’re a homeowner, have you ever had anybody knock on your door and say, “Hey, I want to buy your house?” Well, guess what? That’s what I’m doing right now. **If your home fits any of the descriptions above, you need to give me a call today because I have a buyer for your house.&nbsp;**

If you have further questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.
