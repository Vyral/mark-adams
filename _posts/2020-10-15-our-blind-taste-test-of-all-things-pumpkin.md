<p style="text-align:center;"><em>In honor of fall, we’re (blindly) sampling savory pumpkin-flavored treats.</em></p>

You’ve heard of Blind Melon; please welcome Blind Pumpkin to the stage—a blind pumpkin taste test, that is\! ‘Tis the season for all things pumpkin spice, and we decided to go ALL in. Our buddy, Greg Cowart of NFM Lending, joined Mark and Amy to sample a spread of pumpkin-flavored novelties. Check out this video to see our reactions, reviews, and see which of us has the sharpest palette. As always, thanks for watching\!
