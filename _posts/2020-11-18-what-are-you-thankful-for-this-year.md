*The Mark Adams Team is grateful for so many things this year.*

With the holidays approaching, it’s a great time to pause and reflect on what we’re grateful for.&nbsp;**Today I’m joined by my favorite people, my team, to share what we’re thankful for this holiday season.**

Amy is thankful to have been able to spend a lot more time at home with her family this year. She has also gotten to enjoy decorating her new home in Wintergreen. Her children have been very productive in making ornaments for their Christmas tree at the mountain house. These talented kiddos need their own Etsy account\!

Chloe is grateful for many things that came from quarantine. She’s gotten to fulfill her dream of being a stay-at-home mom while also having a job—the best of both worlds. She’s also thankful for all the educators who have taken an impossible situation and made the best of it. Although homeschooling is challenging, she is glad to have a more active role in Joie’s education.

Fall is Lisa’s favorite time of the year, and is grateful that she’s had the opportunity to spend lots of time with her animals in 2020. She’s thankful for her health and the ability to work from home with her husband (thanks to noise-canceling headphones). She was also given an unusual blessing in the fact that her brother and his family were able to spend more time with their mother, who passed away recently. The hospital allowed his whole family to be there with her, which isn’t typical these days. Also, Lisa is grateful for being able to spend time with friends over Zoom, take walks, and settle into a good book.

As for me, I’m thankful for my friends and family members. This time in quarantine has also given me an opportunity to not only spend more time at home, but also to enjoy the amazing garden my wife created where she’s grown some impressive pumpkins\! One of the most critical lessons we’ve learned during quarantine is how important it is to be around people. Our team has missed meeting in person on a regular basis, so we really appreciate this time we’ve had together today.

**Last, but not least, we’re all thankful for you\!**&nbsp;We’re so grateful for being able to serve such amazing people like yourselves**.**&nbsp;We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.

What are you thankful for this year? Reach out to us and let us know—we’d love to hear about it\!
