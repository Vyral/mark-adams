*You may not be superstitious, but we’re at least a little ‘stitious\!*

We got together as a team to celebrate another successful year in business, in spite of all the curveballs 2020 threw our way. Although it was a great year for many reasons, you might be as happy as we are to say "good riddance\!" to 2020. As our mindsets shift toward 2021, we want to bring about *all* the good fortune possible, so we reminisced on some superstitions from our childhoods. We figure that 2021 may need as many of these good-luck charms and superstitions as it can get, so we went ahead and performed a whole mess of them\!

To start, **Mark's mom always prepared black-eyed peas to eat on New Year's to bring good luck.** He also eats an apple every day to keep the doctor away (would you call that luck or science?). Also, picking up pennies is something he still does to this day.

Chloe also recalls tossing pennies into a fountain as a kid for good luck, and on the first day of every month, **she recites the words "bunny, bunny, bunny”—a twist on the classic "rabbit, rabbit, rabbit" superstition.**

Rabbits are also a part of Amy's good luck traditions. She carries a rabbit's foot to rub for good luck, with much success; it’s brought about some clutch UVA basketball wins and even a surprise baby\!

Lisa has a horseshoe from her grandfather that symbolizes luck, and tosses salt over her shoulder. She also knocks on wood, which is something you might do all the time, too, but do you know why? **In Irish folklore, evil spirits live in the wood, so you must knock on it to deafen their ears to your wishes.**

Lastly, we all decided to cheers to the new year. As it turns out, Spaniards toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass; each one is to be eaten to symbolize 12 months of good luck in the upcoming year.

Here's to your good fortune in 2021\! If we can help you with that, at least by way of your real estate needs, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy holidays to you and yours, and adios, 2020\!
