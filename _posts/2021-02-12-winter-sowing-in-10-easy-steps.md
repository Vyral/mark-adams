Winter sowing is essentially making a mini greenhouse to support seeds while they germinate during the wintertime. The process is simple and almost free to do—you simply put seeds in soil inside a plastic milk jug, seal it, then put it outside and wait for them to sprout.

Here’s a quick step-by-step guide to winter sowing snow peas, which you can also watch in the video above:

**1\.** Take a plastic milk jug and cut it in half horizontally

**2\.** On the bottom half, cut or burn four drainage holes in the bottom and two on the side about an inch up from the bottom

**3\.** Pour about four inches of soil in the bottom half

**4\.** Wet the soil down with a spray bottle

**5\.** Use a marker or even your fingers to poke holes in the dirt, about 1.5 inches deep

**6\.** Place your seeds in the holes, cover them with soil, and wet them—make sure it’s as wet as possible before you seal the jug up to promote condensation inside

**7\.** Put the top half of the jug back on the bottom half and seal them together with duct tape

**8\.** Use a marker to label the jug

**9\.** Place your jugs somewhere outside where the wind (or animals) won’t knock them over

**10\.** Wait for your seeds to sprout\!
