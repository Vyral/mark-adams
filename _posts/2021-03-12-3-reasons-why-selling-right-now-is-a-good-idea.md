<center><em>Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short by waiting to put your home on the market. </em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

We’re in the middle of a market I’ve never seen before in my two decades of real estate. Sellers are at a unique advantage as buyers are using enticing ways to get their offers accepted. **We’re selling homes for well above asking price, and even having appraisal and inspection contingencies waived.&nbsp;**

You might be thinking, “Sure, that sounds amazing, but WHERE am I going to go if I sell my house right now?” I’m getting this question left and right, so I wanted to propose an option. Stick with me while I explain why you should simply move out. Your next dream home may not be available yet, but I have three reasons why you may not want to wait for it to come along to sell your current house. I know the idea of temporary housing doesn’t sound the most appealing, but I’ll tell you why it might be worth it to you.&nbsp;

First, we’re seeing homes sell for $10,000, $20,000, even $40,000 over the asking price. That alone is motivating people to list now. Beyond that, sellers are getting those prices without making any updates, which brings me to my second reason to sell now: Buyers are so eager right now they are willing to forgo inspections and/or they are waiving repairs. We’ve seen it happen with the last three of our contracts. This is saving sellers money and the headache of having contractors in and out of their house. I’ll leave you with the third and perhaps greatest reason to move right now: **The proceeds from the sale put you in the BEST possible cash position to buy your dream home.** And isn’t that the goal?

If you’d like to know what your home could sell for in this market, or you have questions about temporary housing options, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.&nbsp;
