<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how our team can help you make more from your home sale.</em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

It’s an incredibly hot market right now, and it has some people wondering if they even need an agent in order to sell their homes. Though it’s possible to sell on your own, I highly recommend against it.

First of all, we build relationships. Most of our business comes through referrals, and we often work with past clients as well as their friends and family members. It speaks for itself—over the past 20 years, we’ve provided such great service that people consistently return or bring in others for us to serve. If we didn’t do a good job, we wouldn’t be getting that repeat business.

**That’s not the only thing we offer; we also provide monetary value.** Homes are getting so many offers nowadays that it can be difficult to determine which one is the best. The craziness of our market has created a lot of strange situations when it comes to offers, and we have the professional expertise to sift through and figure out which one works well for your needs.

Here’s a quick story that illustrates how we can help you: One of our best clients recently referred a friend to us. This new client was doing a for-sale-by-owner listing, and her property was in fantastic shape—however, her price tag was about $20,000 too high. It wasn’t selling, so we met with her to see what was going on and discovered that the photography was terrible. Additionally, her emotional investment in the home meant she was unable to make objective decisions when it came to offers.&nbsp;

We came in, figured out what her home should actually be priced at, and took good pictures for the listing. **Her property sold the very next week, and at a higher price than she could have gotten on her own.**

The bottom line is that our team holds an incredible amount of knowledge that allows sellers to find exactly what they need. If you’d like to learn more about what we can do for your situation, or if you have any questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to us. Every situation is different and we strive to make the selling process as enjoyable and stress free as possible. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
