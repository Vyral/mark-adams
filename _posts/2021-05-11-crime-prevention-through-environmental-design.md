<center><em>Officer Mashburn is back to discuss CPTED and keeping your home safe.</em></center>

Today our special guest is back by popular demand: Officer Mashburn. The last time she joined us, she talked a bit about environmental design, and we thought it was fascinating, so she’s back to share more about it.&nbsp;

**CPTED is the term used within the police department, and it stands for Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design**. It’s based on the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in fear of crime and improvement in quality of life.&nbsp;

Many things are included in CPTED, but one of the most crucial is natural surveillance or landscaping. For example, homeowners should keep shrubs and trees maintained around their homes so they can see all parts of their house as they walk up to it from the street. Let’s say you have a large bush next to your house—if you keep it maintained, there’s less opportunity for someone to hide behind it. **(Who knew the police had strategic ways they could tell us to landscape to keep safe\!)**

Lighting is another essential aspect, and we call it territorial reinforcement. Lighting shows ownership, and there are four main factors to it: the proper amount, high visibility low-glare, uniformity, and fixture type. Regarding uniformity, whatever lighting is chosen for the front, back, or sides of the home, we recommend that it illuminate that entire part of the house; we don’t want to see pockets of darkness. **When choosing fixtures, ensure they direct light downward**—don’t waste light by directing it horizontally, as that doesn’t cover anything.&nbsp;

We look forward to having Officer Mashburn back again in the future. If you have any questions or real estate needs, please reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.
