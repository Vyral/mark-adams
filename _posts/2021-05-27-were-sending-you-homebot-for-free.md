Do you want to know what your home is worth? Do you want to know how much equity you have in your house? I can provide those answers for free right now. For years, my team and I have been researching companies for an app that we could send to our clients for free that would tell them the value of their homes. We finally found it, and it’s called Homebot.&nbsp;

Here are a few of its great features:

**1\. Home value.** One tap shows you the value of your home. The app may not know about your home’s amenities, so you can also adjust the value higher or lower based on what your home includes.&nbsp;

**2\. Your equity position.** By the time the average American retires, 83% of their wealth comes from home equity. Homebot helps you keep track of your equity position.

**3\. Amortization chart.** This tells you how much you would save on interest if you made extra mortgage payments. Personalized calculations can help you save money and pay off your loans quicker.

**4\. Rent estimation.** If you’ve considered renting out your house or making it an Airbnb, the app will tell you how much you can charge for it.&nbsp;

This app has so many cool features that we think you’ll enjoy exploring. They also have a feature where you can tap a button if you want more specific information about that part of the app. They even have features that can help if you’re thinking about buying a property.

Your house is the largest asset you’re ever likely to own, and Homebot can help you make informed decisions. It's free and provides valuable market data and wealth-building insights.
