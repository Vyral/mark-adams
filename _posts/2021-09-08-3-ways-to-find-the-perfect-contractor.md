Here are my top three methods for finding a great contractor.

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Let me guess: You need a contractor ASAP, but everyone you’ve called is already booked. Don’t worry. Here are three tips to help you find a great contractor:

**1\. Referrals.** Reach out to your list of contacts, neighbors, and even people you know on facebook. If they’ve had contract work done recently, ask them about it. Was it done on time? Did they show up on time? Did they charge a reasonable price? These questions will help you get a feel for the contractor. Then, once you reach out to them, make sure they are licensed and insured. Every job is different, so depending on the work, licensing and insurance could be crucial.&nbsp;

**2\. Call the supply house and talk to sales.** Let me give you an example: When I renovated my house about eight years ago, the trim contractor I usually worked with wasn’t available. I called the lumber house, asked for their top salesperson, and asked them who they would recommend for trim carpeting. The contractor they recommended did a fantastic job, and I still refer him to my clients today. This story just goes to show, if you talk to the top salespeople in an industry, they can probably refer you to an excellent contractor.&nbsp;

**3\. Talk to me.** As you can imagine, I keep in touch with contractors pretty regularly as part of my job. If you need work done on your home, chances are I can refer you to a reliable contractor.&nbsp;
