<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Watch as Greg Cowart rappels down the Dominion Power building.</em></p>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

As you know, we recently participated in the Richmond SPCA's “Over the Edge” fundraiser to raise money for the animals in our community. Those who reached the $2,500 fundraising goal were entered into the "Toss Your Boss" contest - if you hit a certain goal, you got to send your boss over the edge of the second tallest building in RVA.&nbsp;

**We reached and surpassed our goal\!** With your help, we raised $2,874. Lisa surpassed the team goal, guaranteeing herself a rappelling spot, but we decided it would be more fun to raffle Lisa's spot off instead. We held a client and vendor appreciation event in July, and anyone who donated at least $25 was entered into the raffle.&nbsp;

The winner of the raffle was Jesse Perrone, who works with our preferred lender, Greg Cowart of NFM Lending. (You might remember Greg from our pumpkin taste test video.)&nbsp;**Instead of using the ticket for herself, Jesse decided she wanted to toss HER boss.** The funny part was that she didn't tell him\! Instead, she put a lunch date with his wife on his calendar.

He is always able to improvise quickly, and takes surprises very well. **Check out the video above, starting at 0:54,** where we tell Greg that he’s the lucky winner and see footage of him rappelling down the massive edifice. We'd like to give him a special shout-out for not only being a great and trusted lender, but a great sport, too.

If you have any real estate-related questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
