*Watch as Greg Cowart rappels down the Dominion Power building.*

<center>&nbsp;</center>

If you recall, we sent out a message not long ago about raising money for the SPCA, and we were looking for your help. The goal was to raise over $2,500 and win an opportunity to rappel off the 335-foot-tall Dominion Power building.&nbsp;

**We reached and surpassed our goal\!** With your help, we raised $2,700 and raffled off the rappel opportunity to raise even more money. Jessie Perone from NFM Mortgage won the opportunity but graciously gave it to her boss, Greg Cowart. Check out the video above, starting at 0:54, where we tell Greg that he’s the lucky winner and see footage of him rappelling down the massive edifice.

If you have any real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
