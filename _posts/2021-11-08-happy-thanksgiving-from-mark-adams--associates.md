Thank you, thank you, thank you\! Words aren’t enough to express my gratitude for all of you, but I’m going to try.

Lisa and I sit down every year around this time and think about the biggest blessings that have come our way over the last year. The last 12 months have been weird at best, and we know many business owners that are unfortunately no longer in business.&nbsp;

**Because of you, not only did we have a great year, but we thrived in this strange environment.** We can’t thank you enough for your support. There are people that work for us who rely on us and have families, and there are other real estate-adjacent companies that rely on us as well. All of them have been positively affected by you and your trust in us.

**We know how emotional it is to buy a house.** It’s typically the single biggest investment you’ll ever make. Lisa has told me many stories of watching kids growing up in houses and it always brings us back to the time that we got to serve them. We love seeing the pictures and posts of your families on social media. Some of those young kids are now buying homes with us or referring us to their other family members and friends.&nbsp;

For the past 21 years, most of our business has been referral-based. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for that. **If you need anything from us, real estate or not, feel free to reach out because we would absolutely love an opportunity to serve you in any way possible.** We hope you have an amazing holiday season\!
