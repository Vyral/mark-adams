Happy New Year\! It’s the time of year when everyone is making a list of what they want to get done with their home, and I have some great tips to help you accomplish your goals. Lisa and I do this exercise every year, so we want to go over how we revive our home:

**1\. Wipe down your shower after every use.** This will prevent mold from building up, so you won't have to remove it later.&nbsp;

**2\. Re-caulk your shower.** Unfortunately, wiping down your shower won’t prevent the caulk from turning yellow. If you replace the caulk, you’d be surprised how new your shower will look.&nbsp;

**3\. Spray your glass shower door with Rain-X every three months.** This will prevent water and soap scum from sticking to your shower door. It will look brand-new all year round.&nbsp;

**4\. Change your home decor every three months.** Lisa changes our decor based on the season. Her tip for you is that instead of buying new pillows, she simply buys new pillowcases. This way, we get a fresh, seasonal look without breaking the bank.

**5\. Replace the front door mat regularly.** These things don’t last as long as you’d think. If your mat is looking old, consider replacing it.&nbsp;

**6\. Replace the mailbox and replace the post.** It’s subtle, but little things like this can make a big impact on your home.&nbsp;

**7\. Replace the pots for houseplants, and replace your picture frames.** This tip is similar to changing pillowcases. You can make the details of your home seem new and exciting just by changing how they’re framed.&nbsp;

**8\. Make sure the lightbulbs are the same type and color.** This will make your home appear more cohesive.

**9\. Install switch plate covers.** This way, you don’t have to replace the receptacle ever again. The convenience switch plate covers offer is unmatched.&nbsp;

Hopefully, these tips gave you some ideas on how to maintain your home in 2022. If you have a tip you’d like to share with me, leave it in the chat or send me an email. I’d love to share it with everyone else\!
