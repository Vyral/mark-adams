Today I want to talk about fire extinguisher safety and inspections. When I was doing my research on this topic, the first thing I did was look at my fire extinguishers to see if they were safe, full, and able to be used correctly. As it turns out, mine weren’t. Do you remember the last time you checked yours? I have a few helpful tips I learned that I wanted to share with you.&nbsp;

First, when you store your fire extinguisher, the information needs to face the outside so the user can see it when they’re grabbing the canister. You'll also notice a little safety pin on the top - this is what keeps you from accidentally depressing the fire extinguisher. There’s also a gauge that shows how full your extinguisher is. Now keep in mind, just because the canister is full, that doesn't mean the extinguisher is still effective. They do have expiration dates.

Fire extinguishers should be thrown out after about 12 to 13 years and exchanged for a new one. I did some shopping online, and I found that **they are usually between $20 to $30** and can even be bought in packages. Some now come in a smaller form that is perfect to keep in the kitchen. The smaller ones are about the size of an aerosol can, and they’re designed to spray a small fire on your cooktop, but a larger one should still be kept close by.

Did you know there are three classes of fire extinguishers? Class A is for wood or paper products, class B is for liquids, and class C is for electrical fires. When you’re buying your fire extinguisher, you want to get an A, B, and C class fire extinguisher for your kitchen. If you like candles or have a fireplace in the house you should have another fire extinguisher nearby.

I hope you found this information valuable. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
