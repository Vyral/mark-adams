We want to thank everyone who donated to our event, both in person or virtually. This is our 14th year collecting donations for Feed More, and this year we collected a whole truckload of pet food donations for their pet food pantry. This goes toward helping provide senior citizens and shut-ins with food for their pets.

This cause is so important because oftentimes they worry about having to give up their companion, or choose between picking up the prescriptions/food for the animal. Many seniors are often isolated, so keeping a companion in their home is truly a gift. We are very grateful for everyone who chooses to do business with our team because they allow us the opportunity to give back to our community.

Thank you again for spending the morning with us and letting us love on your precious pups. We can’t wait to tell you how much we raised for local pets in need in a future video.&nbsp;

Today we’re sharing a quick slideshow of some great moments that we captured throughout the event. **Watch the video above to see it all.**

If you have any questions for me about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
