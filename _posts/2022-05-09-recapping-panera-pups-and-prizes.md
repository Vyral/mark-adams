Thanks to everyone who came out to our Panera, Pups, and Prizes event recently. We had a blast and loved meeting all of your furry friends. We hope you had fun, too\!

It was a very successful year. We loved handing out all the prizes, and I can’t wait to tell you how much we raised for local pets in need in a future video.&nbsp;

Today we’re sharing a quick slideshow of some great moments that we captured throughout the event. **Watch the video above to see it all.**

If you have any questions for me about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
