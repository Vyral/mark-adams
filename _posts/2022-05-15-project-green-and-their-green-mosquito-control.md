If you’ve got mosquitoes, Alex Kepner from Project Green has an organic cure. Years ago, Lisa got into organic gardening, and she learned just how important the environment is and how much we rely on bees. We get a ton of mosquitoes in our backyard, and Lisa’s research led us to Project Green and their organic mosquito control. We brought Alex out here today to share a bit about what he does.&nbsp;

**How is your treatment different?**

Our goal is to control mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks with natural products like cedar and peppermint oils. At the same time, we don’t want to target the pollinators and beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs.&nbsp;

**What does it look like when you treat our yard, and how is it different from your competitors?**

We use a fogging backpack blower to fog the entire yard and create a perimeter. We’ll target areas where there’s a buildup of mosquitoes, like debris piles, gutters, etc. The methods aren’t much different from what other companies do. The big difference is what’s in the tank.

**You mention that it kills fleas and ticks. We have a dog who likes to eat grass, so is the treatment safe for pets?**

Fortunately, it’s safe for dogs, and we understand that pet safety is a big priority for homeowners. It’s such a fine mist, and it’s made up of essential oils and chemicals that are found in household products. There is little to no harm to dogs. The FDA says there is zero toxicity in our products.&nbsp;

**How long does the treatment last?**

We spray on three-week cycles, but we can run into some issues with heavy rains diluting the product. We ask homeowners to work with us on this. If you see standing water or piles of debris, eliminate them so that we can get the best result.

Sounds like the only thing left to do is get my neighbors on board so that we’re all using the same organic solution. If you want to have Alex take a look at your yard, call him at 804-299-5322 or email him at [hello@projectgreenva.com](mailto:hello@projectgreenva.com). Of course, if you have any real estate questions, feel free to call or email us as well. We’d love to help.
