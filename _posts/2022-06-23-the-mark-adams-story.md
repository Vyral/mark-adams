I love building things and working with people. Looking back, it’s not surprising that I ended up building my own company where a large part of daily operations include working with people and doing what I love.&nbsp;

When I was growing up, my parents built several commercial buildings and owned several businesses at the same time. They would always include me and my siblings in the construction process and the business side of things. They made it fun, and it never really felt like work. **Looking back, I’m pretty sure that’s where I got my entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp;**

One of the best things my dad taught all of us was, “There’s nothing you can’t do if you put your mind to it.” When I was 22, Lisa and I moved to Virginia and the first thing my parents told me to do was buy a house and start building equity for the future. They also suggested building a house because of their experience in construction, and the next thing you know, we found a lot and started building the house.

We hired a jack leg carpenter, Harold Yoho, who helped us along with my dad, working seven days a week for three months to build that house. We got to the closing table, I was fussing about some bills, and the attorney told me that I had made $20,000 in three months by building the house. **I knew then that I was going to be in real estate.** Since then, Lisa and I have built three houses together and renovated a fourth.&nbsp;

We started our real estate company in 1999 with the same drive, determination, and work ethic that we learned from building all those houses. Buying or selling a home is typically the single biggest investment people make. We understand how important that is and how stressful that process can be. That’s why our team consists of a full-time client care manager, a full-time marketing manager, and full-time Realtors with decades of experience so all of your needs are taken care of. We take great pride in the relationships we build and always work relentlessly on our clients’ behalf to help them achieve their real estate goals.

If you have any real estate goals you’d like to discuss or just any general questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
