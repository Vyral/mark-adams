Our market is shifting. Inflation is up, and it’s affecting both buyers and sellers. We want to get ahead of this issue, so we decided we need to provide more value to our sellers while reducing our costs. Let us explain.

It’s easy to forget now, but before the real estate crash of 2008, 2005 and 2006 were the best years for real estate sales in history. We’ve been around long enough to remember this time, and many agents became complacent with their marketing and other services. We believe a lot of agents today have become complacent in a similar way since the market has been so great for so long.&nbsp;

**We’ve never believed in being complacent, so we’re doing a few things to make sure our services are the best they can be.** First, we’re introducing variable rate commissions to help with costs. Plus, we’re improving our professional photography to include traditional and drone photos. Your agent won’t be awkwardly taking photos of your property with their iPhone if you work with us. We’ll even give you the pictures once you close. After all, your home rarely looks better than when you’re trying to sell.&nbsp;

We also have a full-time marketing coordinator to get your home in front of as many buyers as possible. She’ll market your home to over 40 high-traffic websites so everyone can see your property. We’re also introducing an easy-exit release, so if you feel like we aren’t doing what we promised we would, you can walk away with no strings attached.&nbsp;

What if you don’t want to list your home on the open market? Don’t worry; we also have an express offers program. **We can get you an all-cash offer on your home within 24 hours.** If you want to sell the easy way, this option might be for you.&nbsp;

These are just some of the things we offer our clients. If you have questions about today’s topic or anything else, please call or email us. We are always willing to help\!&nbsp;
