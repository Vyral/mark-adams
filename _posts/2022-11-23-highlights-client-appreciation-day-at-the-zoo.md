We just recently had our 6th annual Client Appreciation Day at the Zoo and were thrilled to see all of you there. Not only was this a day to show gratitude for our clients for their support over the years, but it was also an opportunity to support our local community. We gathered pet food donations to support Feed More’s Meals on Wheels program, **which helps out seniors and their animal companions.**

We hope you enjoyed the event as much as we did, and we’ll look forward to seeing you next year\! Remember, if you have any real estate needs or questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d be delighted to help you.
