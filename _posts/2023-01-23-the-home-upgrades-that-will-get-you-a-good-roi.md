I recently went on a listing appointment, and the number one question I got was: What do I need to do to get the most money when preparing my home for sale? In response to this, today I’m sharing what you need and don’t need to do to get top dollar for your property.

**The No. 1 issue that people are always concerned about is their roofs.** If you have a 20-year-old roof that is in good condition, replacing it will cost about $10,000. In my experience, you don't necessarily need to replace it because when the house is sold, you'll only get back your initial $10,000 investment. It will help sell the house, but it doesn't bring you more money when you do sell it. This goes for windows, too, especially replacement windows, which are so expensive these days.&nbsp;

However, if you took that same $10,000 investment and used it to upgrade your kitchen or bathroom, you can get a $15,000 return. **Not all replacements or upgrades will get you a good ROI.** If you are interested in knowing specifically what your house needs to get the most amount of money, feel free to call or email me. I’m always happy to help!
