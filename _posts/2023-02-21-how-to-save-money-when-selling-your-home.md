Do you have an older air conditioning unit and are debating whether or not to replace it before putting your home on the market? In my experience, buying a new unit could cost you over $10,000, and you donâ€™t always get that investment back.&nbsp;

However, one thing you could do is have a technician service the unit and then give you a written report that verifies the unit is operating correctly. Then once you sell your home, the inspector can show this report. **Having it done in advance could save you thousands of dollars.&nbsp;**

If you would like me to take a look at your home and see where I can save you some money, feel free to call or email me anytime. I'd love to help in any way that I can!
