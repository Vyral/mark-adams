I am excited to share the March edition of the Metro Richmond Real Estate Market Quick Stats with you today. **In the last 30 days, the average sales price and the number of new listings have changed**, affecting homes in all price ranges, so I am here to keep you up to date.&nbsp;

First, the average sales price is $351,239, up 6.1% from last year. Secondly, the number of new listings is around 1,399, down 26.8% from last year. This affects all homes differently, so I have split properties into three price ranges.&nbsp;

In the $0 to $350,000 price range, the average house came onto the market at $271,500, sold for $261,500, and included $5,050 of concessions. That means the adjusted sold price is $256,450, and the list-to-sold-price ratio is 94%. Lastly, these homes stayed on the market for an average of 24 days.&nbsp;

We know that values aren’t going down, so these stats show us that **sellers are contributing more and more to the buyers’ costs.** However, this isn’t the same in every price range—in the $351,000 to $650,000 price range, the list-to-sold-price ratio is 98%, and in the $651,000 and up price range, the ratio is 101%. Plus, the numbers have stayed very similar over the last few months in these two ranges, while it has changed more in the first price range.&nbsp;

Typically, when you have a lack of inventory, as we do, that keeps the prices higher. This shows more in the two higher price ranges, while there is the most opportunity in the lower one. Since sellers know they’re going to have to compromise to sell their houses, buyers will have more opportunities.&nbsp;

**If your house is in the lower price range and you’re considering selling, I recommend getting your home on the market sooner rather than later.** Act before the list-to-sold-price ratio continues to drop. If your house is in one of the higher price ranges, you’ll get close to asking price, if not more, so you have more time.&nbsp;

If you want to know what your property is worth and what a buyer might pay for it, call me anytime! I would be happy to look at the numbers in your neighborhood and share that information with you.
