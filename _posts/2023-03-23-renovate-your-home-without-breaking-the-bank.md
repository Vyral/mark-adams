Today, I have some exciting news to share with you! Lately, I've been frequently getting asked if renovating the entire house is necessary for selling in the current real estate market. The short answer is that it depends on the location, but I recommend making your house look as nice as possible to get a higher price and sell it faster. In some cases, a full renovation is necessary to get a better return on your investment.

**The good news is that we've partnered with a few companies that can do these three things for you: loan you the money, hire the contractors, and manage the project.** Plus, they won't charge you a fee, they just have you pay them back when the house sells. It's a win-win situation!&nbsp;

If you're interested, call or email me anytime. I'd be happy to come out and see if this service is right for you!
