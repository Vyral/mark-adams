The real estate market is constantly changing, and staying up-to-date on the latest trends and statistics is crucial for buyers, sellers, and agents alike. To help you do this, we’re taking a closer look at the current real estate market in Metro Richmond and sharing some important data that can help you make informed decisions.&nbsp;

First, **the average sales price in Metro Richmond for March is $400,748.** This is up by 7.4% from the previous year. However, the number of new listings from the same time last year is down by 12.7%, with only 24,262 new listings.&nbsp;

Properties priced from $1 to $350,000 had an average sales price of $252,000 and sellers received an average of $6,000 in concessions, which brought the adjusted sold price to $243,000, or 96% of the original asking price. Also, the properties stayed on the market for an average of 24 days.

For properties priced between 351,000 and 650,000, the numbers have remained relatively consistent throughout the year. They’re selling at around 99% of their asking price, with the occasional sale at 98% or 100%. Then for properties priced at 651,000 and above, the market is still strong, with some homes selling above the asking price.&nbsp;

**The market trends for lower-priced properties suggest that** **some agents are not doing their due diligence when it comes to researching the market.** There have been multiple offers on properties in the last 30 days, but some agents are making offers above the asking price without finding out if there are any other offers on the table. This lack of research and education is leading to clients being confused and missing opportunities.&nbsp;

If you want to buy or sell a property in Richmond, it's essential to work with an agent who understands the current market trends and can educate you on what's happening in your neck of the woods.
