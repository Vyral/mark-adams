Today, we’re here with your May market update to help you stay informed so you can make smart real estate decisions. You need to be aware of certain changes, and we’re here with that information.&nbsp;

First, **the average sales price is up 10.5%, and new listings are down 13.7% from this time last year.** Second, when looking at the sales-to-list-price ratio, we can see that it has stayed fairly consistent over the past few months in all price ranges, around 99%. However, things are very different currently, as many properties that have gone under contract in the last 30 days have sold well above the asking price.&nbsp;

This shows that the real estate market changes daily, so **it’s important to hire a Realtor who will keep you up to date.** A lot of people don’t understand the current market because it’s changing so quickly, but we are here to help with that.&nbsp;

If you are thinking about selling, know that the decrease in new listings is driving prices up. Overall, just make sure to **contact us because we can show you what’s going on in your specific neighborhood.** Then if you want to buy a home, don’t get discouraged. There are still properties out there that are at a good price, and we can help you find them.&nbsp;
