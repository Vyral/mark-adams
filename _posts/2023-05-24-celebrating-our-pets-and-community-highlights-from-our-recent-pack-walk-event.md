Today, we’re very excited to share some of the highlights of our recent events. We had such a blast meeting new people and their dogs. Therefore, we wanted to take some time to share some of our favorite moments with you in the video above.&nbsp;

We love to support local animal causes by organizing pack walks, pet food drives, and more. In April, we hosted a pack walk at Dogwood Dell, sponsored the Doggone 5K, 3K, and 1K events at the Pole Green Park, and supported the Richmond Animal League at the 2023 Woofstock event.&nbsp;**Giving back to the community is an important part of our real estate service, and we love to be able to support our furry friends.**

Enjoy these adorable doggie moments of our recent adventures in the video above—you might even recognize a face or two. Also, if you're interested in entering the real estate market, remember that we’re here for you and that your support allows us to continue giving back to the community. Call or email us anytime, and we would be happy to hear from you.
