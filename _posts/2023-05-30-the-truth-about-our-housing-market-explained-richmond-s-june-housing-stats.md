What’s going on in our housing market? Things are always changing, so today, I want to share the latest numbers you need to know for the June housing market in Richmond. Let's delve into the details.&nbsp;

The average sales price stands at nearly $404,000, indicating a slight increase compared to the same period last year. However, the number of new listings entering the market has decreased by 14.2%. To gain a broader perspective, I analyzed data dating back to 2006.

**Remarkably, this month's new listings mark the lowest count since 2006.** As a result, homes are selling for a higher percentage of their asking prices. In the zero to $350,000 price range, properties are typically sold at 98% of the asking price. For homes priced between $351,000 and $650,000, the average sale price exceeds the asking price. And for properties priced at $651,000 and above, the average sale price is 103% above the asking price.

It is worth noting that we cannot predict when the market dynamics will shift and more inventory will become available. **Currently, we are experiencing the lowest inventory since 2006.&nbsp;**

The truth is that no one knows for sure when or how our market will change, but it certainly will again. If you are thinking of buying or selling soon, just call or email us, and we’ll make sure to keep you informed on what’s happening in our market. We look forward to hearing from you!
