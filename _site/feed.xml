        <title>Winter Sowing Vs. Winter Growing: What's the Difference?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hxeDz7B3RHU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Adams joins me to teach us about winter sowing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa joined me today to share the next phase in her vision for our suburban garden. Since we don’t have a ton of land to farm on, she brought the idea of winter sowing to me, which is so easy to do, we just had to share it with you. Check out Lisa’s step-by-step demonstration in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the difference between winter sowing and winter growing, you ask? Winter sowing is essentisally making a mini greenhouse to support seeds while they germinate during the wintertime. This differs from winter growing, where you plant directly into the ground or utilize a greenhouse or cold frame, in order to produce vegetables that are harvested in the wintertime. What’s great about winter sowing is that you probably already have most of the materials you need at home, aside from the seeds and potting soil, and it takes up very little room in your yard. The process is simple – you put your seeds in soil in a plastic milk jug, seal it, and then put it outside and wait for them to sprout. Then, come springtime, your plants are ready to go in the ground to flourish. The beets, radishes, and broccoli Lisa planted a couple weeks ago are already beginning to grow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to learn more about this method of growing, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/WinterSowing.VegGardeningWithSheryl/?ref=share&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; Lisa belongs to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about real estate or would like more ideas for home projects like this, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Can You Calculate Your Home’s True Worth?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GebFetILLaE?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to get an accurate valuation of your home.&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sellers: Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, Redfin, and every other estimated home value website out there is inaccurate. Heck, even your tax assessor’s office is inaccurate when it comes to valuating your home. Why? Because they use computer-automated programs to estimate its value.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First and foremost, there are many factors that determine a home’s value—location, style, amenities, school district, etc.&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing this, I’ll give you an example of how automated systems can make mistakes. Let’s say there are two houses, House A and House B, from the same neighborhood that were built at the same time (20 years ago) and are the same size: 2,000 square feet. The only difference between them is that House A recently had its kitchen and bathrooms updated and was sold about two years ago. House B, meanwhile, has never been resold since it was built and doesn’t have any upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared.%20http://localhost:4000/how-can-you-calculate-your-homes-true-worth.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an automated system focuses on a certain area, it incorporates all the recent sales data. If it doesn’t know what House B initially sold for, it will use the data from nearby homes that have sold recently. If House A has upgrades, it stands to reason that it’s worth more than House B, but an automated assessment will give House B a higher value. Unfortunately, many people trust these assessments despite the fact that they’re wildly inaccurate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you accurately calculate your home’s worth? &lt;strong&gt;Say hello to your friendly neighborhood Realtor!&lt;/strong&gt; If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared. The thing is, I haven’t seen a real estate market like this in 20 years, and I’m not just saying that. There is very little inventory, and sellers are cashing in on the fact that interest rates are also very low, which means there are a lot of buyers but not enough houses for them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering selling your house in the next six to seven months, call me today so I can give you the very best estimate of its value. If you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shou Sugi Ban: Easy as Ichi, Ni, San</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uUA0HWc4nr4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my recent project of trying the Japanese Shou Sugi Ban technique.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the holidays, my wife &lt;strong&gt;Lisa asked me to build some raised beds for her new garden&lt;/strong&gt;, and they turned out well. However, when I was done, she said they looked bright and new and wondered whether there was any way to treat them to make them appear weathered. She did some internet research and found out about an ancient Japanese technique called Shou Sugi Ban where you lightly char the wood to preserve it.  This technique is not only for garden beds, but any wood-working project, such as sheds, cabinets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully.%20http://localhost:4000/shou-sugi-ban-easy-as-ichi-ni-san.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I went to Lowe’s and found an excellent torch tool that’s designed to burn weeds but works well with this technique. The torch cost about $55, was easy to use, and the tank of gas cost $25. I’m not a Shou Sugi Ban expert, but &lt;strong&gt;here are a few safety tips if you decide to try this project at home:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear a good pair of safety glasses.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear a secure pair of safety gloves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay away from the tank when you’re burning. This torch throws out a large flame, and you don’t want any explosions happening!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully. &lt;strong&gt;Watch me using the Shou Sugi Ban technique starting at 1:00 in the video above. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about how I made these garden beds or concerning real estate, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to share this technique with you. &lt;em&gt;Arigato! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Highest Offer May Not Be the Best, and Here’s Why</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1wTwzh_Rxes?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why the highest offer isn&amp;rsquo;t always the best one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a multiple-offer situation, why is the highest offer not always the best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our listings, we regularly see multiple-offer situations where buyers compete with each other to the point that they’re making offers above asking price. The problem with this is that in their contract, the buyer has the option to order an appraisal. The contract also states that &lt;strong&gt;if the home doesn’t appraise at the written sale price, they have three options:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask the seller to reduce their price to the appraised value. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Negotiate a price somewhere in between&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask to be let out of the contract (if the first two options fail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team and I recently listed a property that snagged seven offers. The top two offers were $30,000 and $23,000 above asking price. The buyer behind the second offer, though, negotiated up front with the sellers that they would pay the difference between the written sale price and appraised value if it happened to be less. That was huge, and the buyer behind the first offer didn’t include that kind of contingency in it, which meant if the home didn’t appraise, they’d have a problem on their hands. When we did a comparative market analysis of the area, we discovered that the price that buyer offered didn’t support the comps, so that was likely where their deal would’ve ended up. &lt;strong&gt;In this case, the second buyer clearly had the better offer.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or would like to know what your home is worth in today’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>January 2021 Richmond home price update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/adams-fb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends and Clients —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real estate market continues to surge ahead. However, clouds might be forming on the horizon for sellers. Let me give you the details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Ultra-low mortgage rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2020, the popular 30-year fixed mortgage rate set 15 new record lows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ended 2020 just one basis point higher than the latest record low and currently stands at 2.86%, a full percentage point lower than one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ultra-low mortgage rates are driving an increase in demand. Unfortunately, sales are restricted due to…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Record-low inventory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were just 1.28 million homes available for sale at the end of November, the last month for which we have full data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is down 22% from a year earlier. It is also the lowest inventory count since the National Association of Realtors began tracking this metric in 1982.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, home prices are shooting up thanks to strong demand and record low inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The median price of an existing home sold in November was a staggering 14.6% higher than in November 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried this pace is unsustainable, you might be right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. A change in the market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some experts warn that home prices are overheating and that affordability is suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might have a point because, after five consecutive months of gains, closed sales of existing homes lowered in November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, after three straight months of record highs, homebuilder confidence in December dropped 4%. December mortgage applications also fell. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what does this all mean for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, things might get harder soon for home sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lower affordability could hurt demand, and the price growth we’ve seen over the past months might slow down, or prices might decrease like we started to see before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, nationwide trends haven’t caught up to us yet in Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand is still very strong.&lt;/strong&gt; If you were to list now, you could sell quickly and at top dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to get an idea of what your home is worth right now, you can use the following home value calculator, which is based on recent Richmond sales:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://markadamsblog.com/homevalue/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Enter your address here to find out what your home is currently worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are considering selling while the current market lasts, give me a call at &lt;strong&gt;804.237.8585.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve helped many people sell in these pandemic circumstances, and I’m here to answer your questions and help however I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a friend or family member thinking about selling it would be my pleasure to earn their business. Don’t hesitate to call me and I promise to take great care of them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great day,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mark Adams&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Q: What Are Your Good Luck Superstitions?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOmDuz4kqZU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may not be superstitious, but we’re at least a little ‘stitious!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got together as a team to celebrate another successful year in business, in spite of all the curveballs 2020 threw our way. Although it was a great year for many reasons, you might be as happy as we are to say “good riddance!” to 2020. As our mindsets shift toward 2021, we want to bring about &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the good fortune possible, so we reminisced on some superstitions from our childhoods. We figure that 2021 may need as many of these good-luck charms and superstitions as it can get, so we went ahead and performed a whole mess of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, &lt;strong&gt;Mark’s mom always prepared black-eyed peas to eat on New Year’s to bring good luck.&lt;/strong&gt; He also eats an apple every day to keep the doctor away (would you call that luck or science?). Also, picking up pennies is something he still does to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloe also recalls tossing pennies into a fountain as a kid for good luck, and on the first day of every month, &lt;strong&gt;she recites the words “bunny, bunny, bunny”—a twist on the classic “rabbit, rabbit, rabbit” superstition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=People in Spain toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass, symbolizing 12 months of good luck for the new year.%20http://localhost:4000/q-what-are-your-good-luck-superstitions.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“People in Spain toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass, symbolizing 12 months of good luck for the new year.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rabbits are also a part of Amy’s good luck traditions. She carries a rabbit’s foot to rub for good luck, with much success; it’s brought about some clutch UVA basketball wins and even a surprise baby!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa has a horseshoe from her grandfather that symbolizes luck, and tosses salt over her shoulder. She also knocks on wood, which is something you might do all the time, too, but do you know why? &lt;strong&gt;In Irish folklore, evil spirits live in the wood, so you must knock on it to deafen their ears to your wishes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we all decided to cheers to the new year. As it turns out, Spaniards toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass; each one is to be eaten to symbolize 12 months of good luck in the upcoming year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to your good fortune in 2021! If we can help you with that, at least by way of your real estate needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Happy holidays to you and yours, and adios, 2020!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Q: How Can You Stay Safe This Holiday Season?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijFyfHHp7uc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Officer Mashburn shares some simple but important tips for holiday safety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Tis the season to be jolly! Let’s prevent some criminal folly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We stole some of Officer Mashburn’s time, but we promise it was for a good cause.&lt;/strong&gt; She joined us to answer some questions about deterring crime during the holiday season. Curious what you could take away from her message? Check out our brief interview in the video above to learn some great tips on protecting your deliveries from “porch pirates,” as well as protecting yourself, your home, and your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re just looking for quick tips to snatch ‘n grab, here are the highlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leave special instructions for delivery drivers for where to place your packages; ask that they hide them behind outdoor furniture or leave them at a side door where they are less visible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep all of your doors/windows locked at all times! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t leave valuables (shopping bags, presents, etc.) in your car. Take them inside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leave your lights on, especially your outdoor lights. Sure, it might run up your electric bill, but on the plus side, Santa will have no problem finding your house!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Officer Mashburn for spending time with us and for serving our communities. &lt;strong&gt;Even during this busy time of year, we’ll be here to help with any real estate needs you may have.&lt;/strong&gt; Happy holidays, and stay safe, friends!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Are You Thankful for This Year?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/34MLnWGVSmo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mark Adams Team is grateful for so many things this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the holidays approaching, it’s a great time to pause and reflect on what we’re grateful for. &lt;strong&gt;Today I’m joined by my favorite people, my team, to share what we’re thankful for this holiday season.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy is thankful to have been able to spend a lot more time at home with her family this year. She has also gotten to enjoy decorating her new home in Wintergreen. Her children have been very productive in making ornaments for their Christmas tree at the mountain house. These talented kiddos need their own Etsy account!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chloe is grateful for many things that came from quarantine. She’s gotten to fulfill her dream of being a stay-at-home mom while also having a job—the best of both worlds. She’s also thankful for all the educators who have taken an impossible situation and made the best of it. Although homeschooling is challenging, she is glad to have a more active role in Joie’s education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.%20http://localhost:4000/what-are-you-thankful-for-this-year.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall is Lisa’s favorite time of the year, and is grateful that she’s had the opportunity to spend lots of time with her animals in 2020. She’s thankful for her health and the ability to work from home with her husband (thanks to noise-canceling headphones). She was also given an unusual blessing in the fact that her brother and his family were able to spend more time with their mother, who passed away recently. The hospital allowed his whole family to be there with her, which isn’t typical these days. Also, Lisa is grateful for being able to spend time with friends over Zoom, take walks, and settle into a good book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me, I’m thankful for my friends and family members. This time in quarantine has also given me an opportunity to not only spend more time at home, but also to enjoy the amazing garden my wife created where she’s grown some impressive pumpkins! One of the most critical lessons we’ve learned during quarantine is how important it is to be around people. Our team has missed meeting in person on a regular basis, so we really appreciate this time we’ve had together today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last, but not least, we’re all thankful for you!&lt;/strong&gt; We’re so grateful for being able to serve such amazing people like yourselves&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are you thankful for this year? Reach out to us and let us know—we’d love to hear about it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Blind Taste Test of All Things Pumpkin</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/epHueuztr2I?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In honor of fall, we’re (blindly) sampling savory pumpkin-flavored treats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of Blind Melon; please welcome Blind Pumpkin to the stage—a blind pumpkin taste test, that is! ‘Tis the season for all things pumpkin spice. We decided to take a break from work and go ALL in. Our buddy, Greg Cowart of NFM Lending, joined Mark and Amy to sample a spread of pumpkin-flavored novelties dished out by Lisa and Chloe (who may have snuck in some mind games). Check out this video to see our reactions, reviews, and see which of us has the sharpest palette.  And now that the sugar coma has worn off, we’re back to work, so don’t hesitate to give us a shout for your real estate needs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for watching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Q: How do you know if refinancing is right for you?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CK7uEyzsgUU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the market, should you stay in your home and refinance or just sell it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you stay in your current house and refinance or should you prepare to sell it because the market is so attractive for sellers right now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are a couple of questions you’ll need to ask yourself before you can make this decision:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long will I stay in the area? &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does it cost to refinance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have the answers to those questions, choosing which path is right for you should be a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about the refinancing process. A good rule of thumb is that if you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance. Typically, there are fees associated with refinancing. To find out what those fees are, just &lt;strong&gt;ask your mortgage company for a good faith estimate.&lt;/strong&gt; That will have a list of all the fees associated with refinancing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance.%20http://localhost:4000/q-how-do-you-know-if-refinancing-is-right-for-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that it’s going to cost $2,000 to refinance your house. In this scenario, you’ll get a 1% reduction in your interest rate, so you’d save $100 a month on your mortgage if you do refinance. In this case, it would take you 20 months to pay off the $2,000 investment. Ask yourself if it makes sense to even invest your money right now if it’ll take that long to recoup. &lt;strong&gt;It might make more sense to use that money to fix your house up&lt;/strong&gt; so that when you get ready to sell in two or three years, you’ll get top dollar for it. It just depends on your situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re still not sure about which path is right for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to share my advice about what exactly you can do to your house to get the biggest bang for your buck. I can also give you guidance about whether it makes sense to refinance your house instead. It’s my pleasure to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
