Lisa Adams joins me to teach us about winter sowing.

Lisa joined me today to share the next phase in her vision for our suburban garden. Since we don’t have a ton of land to farm on, she brought the idea of winter sowing to me, which is so easy to do, we just had to share it with you. Check out Lisa’s step-by-step demonstration in the video above.

So, what is the difference between winter sowing and winter growing, you ask? Winter sowing is essentisally making a mini greenhouse to support seeds while they germinate during the wintertime. This differs from winter growing, where you plant directly into the ground or utilize a greenhouse or cold frame, in order to produce vegetables that are harvested in the wintertime. What’s great about winter sowing is that you probably already have most of the materials you need at home, aside from the seeds and potting soil, and it takes up very little room in your yard. The process is simple – you put your seeds in soil in a plastic milk jug, seal it, and then put it outside and wait for them to sprout. Then, come springtime, your plants are ready to go in the ground to flourish. The beets, radishes, and broccoli Lisa planted a couple weeks ago are already beginning to grow!

If you’d like to learn more about this method of growing, here is the Facebook group Lisa belongs to.

If you have any questions about real estate or would like more ideas for home projects like this, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

Here&rsquo;s how to get an accurate valuation of your home.

&nbsp;

Sellers: Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, Redfin, and every other estimated home value website out there is inaccurate. Heck, even your tax assessor’s office is inaccurate when it comes to valuating your home. Why? Because they use computer-automated programs to estimate its value.  

First and foremost, there are many factors that determine a home’s value—location, style, amenities, school district, etc. Knowing this, I’ll give you an example of how automated systems can make mistakes. Let’s say there are two houses, House A and House B, from the same neighborhood that were built at the same time (20 years ago) and are the same size: 2,000 square feet. The only difference between them is that House A recently had its kitchen and bathrooms updated and was sold about two years ago. House B, meanwhile, has never been resold since it was built and doesn’t have any upgrades. 

“If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared.”

When an automated system focuses on a certain area, it incorporates all the recent sales data. If it doesn’t know what House B initially sold for, it will use the data from nearby homes that have sold recently. If House A has upgrades, it stands to reason that it’s worth more than House B, but an automated assessment will give House B a higher value. Unfortunately, many people trust these assessments despite the fact that they’re wildly inaccurate. 

So how can you accurately calculate your home’s worth? Say hello to your friendly neighborhood Realtor! If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared. The thing is, I haven’t seen a real estate market like this in 20 years, and I’m not just saying that. There is very little inventory, and sellers are cashing in on the fact that interest rates are also very low, which means there are a lot of buyers but not enough houses for them all. 

If you’re considering selling your house in the next six to seven months, call me today so I can give you the very best estimate of its value. If you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s my recent project of trying the Japanese Shou Sugi Ban technique.

&nbsp;

Over the holidays, my wife Lisa asked me to build some raised beds for her new garden, and they turned out well. However, when I was done, she said they looked bright and new and wondered whether there was any way to treat them to make them appear weathered. She did some internet research and found out about an ancient Japanese technique called Shou Sugi Ban where you lightly char the wood to preserve it.  This technique is not only for garden beds, but any wood-working project, such as sheds, cabinets, etc.

“We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully.”

So, I went to Lowe’s and found an excellent torch tool that’s designed to burn weeds but works well with this technique. The torch cost about $55, was easy to use, and the tank of gas cost $25. I’m not a Shou Sugi Ban expert, but here are a few safety tips if you decide to try this project at home:


  Wear a good pair of safety glasses.
  Wear a secure pair of safety gloves.
  Stay away from the tank when you’re burning. This torch throws out a large flame, and you don’t want any explosions happening!


We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully. Watch me using the Shou Sugi Ban technique starting at 1:00 in the video above. 

If you have any questions about how I made these garden beds or concerning real estate, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to share this technique with you. Arigato!

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s why the highest offer isn&rsquo;t always the best one.

&nbsp;

In a multiple-offer situation, why is the highest offer not always the best?

For our listings, we regularly see multiple-offer situations where buyers compete with each other to the point that they’re making offers above asking price. The problem with this is that in their contract, the buyer has the option to order an appraisal. The contract also states that if the home doesn’t appraise at the written sale price, they have three options:


  Ask the seller to reduce their price to the appraised value. 
  Negotiate a price somewhere in between
  Ask to be let out of the contract (if the first two options fail)


My team and I recently listed a property that snagged seven offers. The top two offers were $30,000 and $23,000 above asking price. The buyer behind the second offer, though, negotiated up front with the sellers that they would pay the difference between the written sale price and appraised value if it happened to be less. That was huge, and the buyer behind the first offer didn’t include that kind of contingency in it, which meant if the home didn’t appraise, they’d have a problem on their hands. When we did a comparative market analysis of the area, we discovered that the price that buyer offered didn’t support the comps, so that was likely where their deal would’ve ended up. In this case, the second buyer clearly had the better offer. 

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or would like to know what your home is worth in today’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

Friends and Clients —

The real estate market continues to surge ahead. However, clouds might be forming on the horizon for sellers. Let me give you the details:

1. Ultra-low mortgage rates

Throughout 2020, the popular 30-year fixed mortgage rate set 15 new record lows. 

It ended 2020 just one basis point higher than the latest record low and currently stands at 2.86%, a full percentage point lower than one year ago.

These ultra-low mortgage rates are driving an increase in demand. Unfortunately, sales are restricted due to…

2. Record-low inventory

There were just 1.28 million homes available for sale at the end of November, the last month for which we have full data.

That is down 22% from a year earlier. It is also the lowest inventory count since the National Association of Realtors began tracking this metric in 1982.

Unsurprisingly, home prices are shooting up thanks to strong demand and record low inventory.

The median price of an existing home sold in November was a staggering 14.6% higher than in November 2019.

If you’re worried this pace is unsustainable, you might be right:

3. A change in the market?

Some experts warn that home prices are overheating and that affordability is suffering.

They might have a point because, after five consecutive months of gains, closed sales of existing homes lowered in November. 

Similarly, after three straight months of record highs, homebuilder confidence in December dropped 4%. December mortgage applications also fell. 

So what does this all mean for you?

Well, things might get harder soon for home sellers.

Lower affordability could hurt demand, and the price growth we’ve seen over the past months might slow down, or prices might decrease like we started to see before the pandemic.

Fortunately, nationwide trends haven’t caught up to us yet in Richmond.

Demand is still very strong. If you were to list now, you could sell quickly and at top dollar.

If you’d like to get an idea of what your home is worth right now, you can use the following home value calculator, which is based on recent Richmond sales:

If you are considering selling while the current market lasts, give me a call at 804.237.8585. I’ve helped many people sell in these pandemic circumstances, and I’m here to answer your questions and help however I can.

If you have a friend or family member thinking about selling it would be my pleasure to earn their business. Don’t hesitate to call me and I promise to take great care of them.  

Have a great day,

Mark Adams

You may not be superstitious, but we’re at least a little ‘stitious!

We got together as a team to celebrate another successful year in business, in spite of all the curveballs 2020 threw our way. Although it was a great year for many reasons, you might be as happy as we are to say “good riddance!” to 2020. As our mindsets shift toward 2021, we want to bring about all the good fortune possible, so we reminisced on some superstitions from our childhoods. We figure that 2021 may need as many of these good-luck charms and superstitions as it can get, so we went ahead and performed a whole mess of them!

To start, Mark’s mom always prepared black-eyed peas to eat on New Year’s to bring good luck. He also eats an apple every day to keep the doctor away (would you call that luck or science?). Also, picking up pennies is something he still does to this day.

Chloe also recalls tossing pennies into a fountain as a kid for good luck, and on the first day of every month, she recites the words “bunny, bunny, bunny”—a twist on the classic “rabbit, rabbit, rabbit” superstition.

“People in Spain toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass, symbolizing 12 months of good luck for the new year.”

Rabbits are also a part of Amy’s good luck traditions. She carries a rabbit’s foot to rub for good luck, with much success; it’s brought about some clutch UVA basketball wins and even a surprise baby!

Lisa has a horseshoe from her grandfather that symbolizes luck, and tosses salt over her shoulder. She also knocks on wood, which is something you might do all the time, too, but do you know why? In Irish folklore, evil spirits live in the wood, so you must knock on it to deafen their ears to your wishes.

Lastly, we all decided to cheers to the new year. As it turns out, Spaniards toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass; each one is to be eaten to symbolize 12 months of good luck in the upcoming year.

Here’s to your good fortune in 2021! If we can help you with that, at least by way of your real estate needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Happy holidays to you and yours, and adios, 2020!

Officer Mashburn shares some simple but important tips for holiday safety.

‘Tis the season to be jolly! Let’s prevent some criminal folly.

We stole some of Officer Mashburn’s time, but we promise it was for a good cause. She joined us to answer some questions about deterring crime during the holiday season. Curious what you could take away from her message? Check out our brief interview in the video above to learn some great tips on protecting your deliveries from “porch pirates,” as well as protecting yourself, your home, and your vehicle.

If you’re just looking for quick tips to snatch ‘n grab, here are the highlights:


  
    Leave special instructions for delivery drivers for where to place your packages; ask that they hide them behind outdoor furniture or leave them at a side door where they are less visible.
  
  
    Keep all of your doors/windows locked at all times! 
  
  
    Don’t leave valuables (shopping bags, presents, etc.) in your car. Take them inside.
  
  
    Leave your lights on, especially your outdoor lights. Sure, it might run up your electric bill, but on the plus side, Santa will have no problem finding your house!

The Mark Adams Team is grateful for so many things this year.

With the holidays approaching, it’s a great time to pause and reflect on what we’re grateful for. Today I’m joined by my favorite people, my team, to share what we’re thankful for this holiday season.

Amy is thankful to have been able to spend a lot more time at home with her family this year. She has also gotten to enjoy decorating her new home in Wintergreen. Her children have been very productive in making ornaments for their Christmas tree at the mountain house. These talented kiddos need their own Etsy account!

Chloe is grateful for many things that came from quarantine. She’s gotten to fulfill her dream of being a stay-at-home mom while also having a job—the best of both worlds. She’s also thankful for all the educators who have taken an impossible situation and made the best of it. Although homeschooling is challenging, she is glad to have a more active role in Joie’s education.

“We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.”

Fall is Lisa’s favorite time of the year, and is grateful that she’s had the opportunity to spend lots of time with her animals in 2020. She’s thankful for her health and the ability to work from home with her husband (thanks to noise-canceling headphones). She was also given an unusual blessing in the fact that her brother and his family were able to spend more time with their mother, who passed away recently. The hospital allowed his whole family to be there with her, which isn’t typical these days. Also, Lisa is grateful for being able to spend time with friends over Zoom, take walks, and settle into a good book.

As for me, I’m thankful for my friends and family members. This time in quarantine has also given me an opportunity to not only spend more time at home, but also to enjoy the amazing garden my wife created where she’s grown some impressive pumpkins! One of the most critical lessons we’ve learned during quarantine is how important it is to be around people. Our team has missed meeting in person on a regular basis, so we really appreciate this time we’ve had together today.

Last, but not least, we’re all thankful for you! We’re so grateful for being able to serve such amazing people like yourselves. We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.

What are you thankful for this year? Reach out to us and let us know—we’d love to hear about it!

In honor of fall, we’re (blindly) sampling savory pumpkin-flavored treats.

You may have heard of Blind Melon; please welcome Blind Pumpkin to the stage—a blind pumpkin taste test, that is! ‘Tis the season for all things pumpkin spice. We decided to take a break from work and go ALL in. Our buddy, Greg Cowart of NFM Lending, joined Mark and Amy to sample a spread of pumpkin-flavored novelties dished out by Lisa and Chloe (who may have snuck in some mind games). Check out this video to see our reactions, reviews, and see which of us has the sharpest palette.  And now that the sugar coma has worn off, we’re back to work, so don’t hesitate to give us a shout for your real estate needs!

As always, thanks for watching!

        <description>

Given the market, should you stay in your home and refinance or just sell it?

Should you stay in your current house and refinance or should you prepare to sell it because the market is so attractive for sellers right now? 

There are a couple of questions you’ll need to ask yourself before you can make this decision:


  How long will I stay in the area? 
  What does it cost to refinance?


Once you have the answers to those questions, choosing which path is right for you should be a little easier.

Now let’s talk about the refinancing process. A good rule of thumb is that if you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance. Typically, there are fees associated with refinancing. To find out what those fees are, just ask your mortgage company for a good faith estimate. That will have a list of all the fees associated with refinancing.

“If you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance.”

Suppose that it’s going to cost $2,000 to refinance your house. In this scenario, you’ll get a 1% reduction in your interest rate, so you’d save $100 a month on your mortgage if you do refinance. In this case, it would take you 20 months to pay off the $2,000 investment. Ask yourself if it makes sense to even invest your money right now if it’ll take that long to recoup. It might make more sense to use that money to fix your house up so that when you get ready to sell in two or three years, you’ll get top dollar for it. It just depends on your situation.

If you’re still not sure about which path is right for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to share my advice about what exactly you can do to your house to get the biggest bang for your buck. I can also give you guidance about whether it makes sense to refinance your house instead. It’s my pleasure to help you.

Here’s how we’re helping other small businesses in our community grow.

Lisa and I started our business 21 years ago, and we quickly learned we had no idea how to run a small business. 

I sought out information at a real estate conference, where I met a coach who told me something that has stuck with me after all these years: “If you’re going to be a business owner, you need to make personal growth a part of your routine for the rest of your life.” 

“We will be offering training, networking, and much more.”

Two years later, I met another speaker who introduced me to the idea of masterminding. I learned how important it is to seek out other business owners in my field so that we can share experiences and learn from one another with the common goal of elevating ourselves and our industry. 

That’s the purpose of the group I started on Facebook, Intentional Business Owners of RVA. We will be offering training on business and personal growth, networking opportunities, and promoting your business connections via individual spotlights. If you are a small business owner, or know someone who is, we would love to have you be a part of our new community.

        <description>Have you been thinking about what your home is worth lately?I wanted to let you know Richmond home prices are not dropping in spite of the seemingly never ending curve balls 2020 is throwing.

In fact, while inventory is down 40% nationally since sellers are likely hesitant to have buyers walk through their home, home prices are still strong (if not stronger).

Would you like to know what your home here in Richmond is worth for free? Call me at 804-237-8585. You’ll get my recommended home value opinion at no charge.

I just need a quick phone call with you to learn more about your home, along with any photos or videos you can send me (very important) by email, text, FB Messenger, etc. You’ll have a better idea of what a bank may value your home for a refinance, you can update your balance sheet, or you can just rest assured knowing what a buyer would likely pay today. 

Just last month, we worked with two families whose homes sold for 8% and 14% over the list price. You can imagine how pleased these clients were!

Interest rates are at record lows after the Federal Reserve lowered their lending rate and bank reserve requirements. This keeps home prices high since money is cheap for borrowers. 

History shows this amazing trend won’t go on forever. If you’re thinking about selling your home, this summer/fall may be your best chance to land your highest selling price.

I’m here to help with any real estate needs you have. Let me know if you have any questions. I’ll give you a well-researched and accurate answer so you can make the right decisions.

Our real estate market is red-hot for sellers right now.

Now, I’m not big on predictions when it comes to the real estate market, but I am big on giving you statistical data directly from our Richmond Metro MLS so you know what’s specifically happening right now. The three things you need to know before you get ready to sell are:

1. Average days on market. Right now, that number is 28 days in Richmond.

2. Average list-to-sale-price ratio. This is 100% right now, meaning that sellers are getting full price for their homes.

3. Inventory. We have only 1.3 months right now. To give you some perspective, a seller’s market is anything under six months and a buyer’s market is anything over six months. With just 1.3 months, we have an extreme seller’s market.

“I’ve never seen a market like this before.”

This checks out when it comes to what we’ve been experiencing with our clients. We’re working with one seller right now who got an offer that was 15% above asking price. Another seller got a sight-unseen cash offer of 8% over their list price. It’s a crazy market, and I’ve never seen anything like this in 21 years in the business.

If you’re even entertaining the idea of selling your home right now, I would love to give you some advice on how to proceed. Just give me a call or send me an email today with any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I’m digital door knocking to find homes for some of my buyers.

Today I wanted to share a new opportunity with you that I call “Digital Door Knocking.” As I’m sure many of you are aware, we are experiencing a shortage of inventory in the market right now. In other words, there are not a lot of homes for sale.

I’m doing things a little bit differently by telling you about some of the buyers we are currently working with and what they are specifically looking for.

First, we have this awesome couple with two kids who are looking in the Freeman school district. They want a home with four bedrooms, under $400,000, and most importantly, an in-law suite. 

Next, we have another couple who are first-time homebuyers with one child. They’re looking for a home in the Bellevue and/or Lakeside area with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and under $350,000.

“If your home fits any of these descriptions, I want to buy your house.”

Another couple we’re working with are empty nesters who are moving back to Richmond. Location is not as important to them as the home. They’re looking for a contemporary house, and their budget is $1 million.

Finally, we have an amazing family of four who are looking for a home with five acres or more in the Louisa, Goochland, Hanover area. They need to have a basement and their budget is under $500,000.

If you’re a homeowner, have you ever had anybody knock on your door and say, “Hey, I want to buy your house?” Well, guess what? That’s what I’m doing right now. If your home fits any of the descriptions above, you need to give me a call today because I have a buyer for your house. 

If you have further questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

These lessons from my father shaped my view of the world.

Last month, we shared fond memories of our dads as a Father’s Day tribute. It got me thinking about the many lessons my father taught me that have shaped the person I am today. I wanted to share a few of my favorite lessons that I refer back to frequently. You may have heard these very same things from your father, mother, or mentor, or perhaps they will stir up other classic ‘dad phrases,’ which I hope bring a smile to your face.

1. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right. When I was a young man, my father was a flooring contractor and used to bring me to work during summer break. He asked me to prep the floor so that he could lay the flooring when I was done. When I was finished, I went up to him and told him the floor was ready. However, he brought me back over to the floor and pointed out some dust that I had left behind. He told me that because I left the dust there, the glue wouldn’t stick and the floor would eventually come up. He proceeded to show me how to sweep the floor correctly. 

“I love my dad for giving me the gift of being able to live my life without fear.”

2. Always be teaching. My father was incredibly gifted with his hands. He worked on cars, lawnmowers, the house, and anything else he could get his hands on. He always brought me, my brother, and my sister along, too. As an adult, when I’m working with someone who’s never used a specific tool, I realize that it takes 10 times longer to show them how to do it rather than just doing it yourself. I have so much more respect for my father now because he was showing us how to do these things without hesitation when we were with him.

3. There’s nothing you can break that I can’t fix. I remember when I was about 20 years old, my father owned an excavating business and a piece of equipment called a backhoe. The problem with using this machine is that, in tight corners, the backhoe will hit things. He came up to me and let me know that I need to be cognizant of making tight turns if I want to avoid causing damage. Then he uttered these words: Son, there is nothing you can break that I can’t fix. He was basically telling me that it was OK to fail, and these words have shaped the lives of me and my siblings. I will never, ever forget that lesson, and I love my dad for giving me the gift of being able to live my life without fear attached to it.

I hold all three of these lessons with me every single day, and they have shaped my life in unimaginable ways. I’m glad to be able to pass them along here.

If you have any questions or real estate needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I would love to hear from you.

Here’s how we help our clients who need to buy and sell simultaneously.

I get this question a lot: “Mark, we want to buy a house, but we have to sell our current home first. We don’t want to risk carrying two mortgages, so how is this possible? The idea of an extra monthly payment is scary, but we have a solid strategy we’ve been using for years to ensure you don’t get caught in this financial bind. Check out this short video to see how we minimize the risk of buying and selling at the same time and give you the confidence to achieve your real estate goals. 

If you have questions about how we can help you buy a home, sell a home, or both at once, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Now is a great time to stop renting and become a homeowner. Here’s why.

When you own a home, you enjoy certain advantages that renters don’t get. Here are the top five reasons to buy your own home instead of renting:

1. You can make changes to the property. This could include changing the paint color, adding a big garden, and other projects that you just can’t do in a rental property.

2. You can write off interest annually. When you make your monthly payment on your mortgage, a portion of that goes toward interest, and you get to write that interest off on an annual basis.

4. Home equity. When you make your payment each month, you’re decreasing the life of the loan. The gap between how much you still owe and the value of your property is called equity, which can be used for multiple purposes.

5. Small business write-offs. If you own a small business and you’re using your home to operate that business, you get to write a portion of it off, which is especially nice given our current environment.

If you have any questions about this information or I can help you in any way, feel free to reach out to me.

These numbers show our market is a strong sellers' market.

I’ve been getting a lot of questions about property values and recent home sale numbers. Today I want to address both topics with some hard data. For example, the median sale price in April 2019 was $259,000. This April, the median price was $271,538. People are still buying and selling homes right now. We’re taking every precaution to make sure all of our clients remain safe and healthy throughout the process. To learn more, watch the short video above.

Back before social distancing, my team got together to celebrate National Pizza Party Week. Check out our party in the video above!

One thing I love most about Superstars Pizza is that you can get pizza by the slice to customize your own bite instead of having to compromise with the rest of your family. When our team got together for our pizza party, we ordered eight equally delicious slices of all different types. We also dished out our individual pizza-eating quirks, and even tried a new approach to savoring a slice. We hope you get a kick out of our conversation!

I’m sharing our latest real estate market statistics.

Yes, we’re all stuck at home, but happy spring anyway! For the last few weeks, everyone has been asking what’s going on in our real estate market and where it’s heading. Many people are getting their information online or through the news, but the info we’re sharing comes directly from our Multiple Listing Service (MLS). As of the recording of this video, in the last three days, there were 209 new listings on the marketplace, 214 homes actually went under contract, and 141 closed. So right now, we’re in a seller’s market. To learn more about our market, watch the short video above.

Here’s a light-hearted look at how I’m keeping my real estate business moving in these unusual times.

Everyone on the team is adjusting to our new work-at-home routines, including the pets. Today, instead of offering market statistics or future projections, I thought I’d share something on a lighter note. I’m giving you exclusive access into my new typical day at the office! Some of my morning rituals remain the same, but the commute sure looks different… Hope this leaves you smiling! 

If you have any questions about real estate, you know where to find me—at home, still working hard for our clients! Reach out by phone or email and I’d be happy to address your needs. Until then, stay safe, and make the most out of today!

Hi there, Mark Adams here. I hope you and your family are staying well. I wanted to address the questions I’ve been getting lately regarding our current market.

“Mark, what’s really going on in the marketplace right now? Is now a good time to sell my house, or should we wait?

I’ve been in the business for 21 years now, and pushed through several market crises. We thrive during times like this because of the sturdy relationships we’ve built with lenders, attorneys, movers, and other service providers. We are prepared to continue serving you in the same capacity we always have.

“It’s still a seller’s market, but the interest rates will save you tons of money.”

The bottom line is, it’s still a seller’s market, and due to the low inventory, those that do put their house on the market are going to have less competition.

As far as buyers are concerned: yes, there is less inventory to choose from, BUT the interest rates are so attractive right now, so when you do find your dream home, it’s going to save you tons of money.

If you have any questions about your property or the buying/selling process, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here for you, and ready to help in any way we can. Stay safe, and we look forward to serving you.

March 14 is National Pi(e) Day and National Chip Day. Today we’re celebrating in advance.

Did you know that March 14 is National Potato Chip Day? In honor of the occasion, I wanted to get together with my team to discuss some of our favorite salty, crispy, and crunchy treats.

My favorite are the classic potato sticks. They’re crispy, salty, and delicious.

Chloe’s are Pringles, which bring back fond memories of her mom sending her care packages filled with Pringles every summer at camp.

“What’s your favorite chip?”

Lisa brought Andy Capp Hot Fries, which she wasn’t introduced to until she met me. In addition to being crunchy and crispy, they add a little bit of spice.

Amy brought a local treat, Mama Saba’s Pita Chips. They are a scrumptious, slightly healthier alternative to potato chips. She also brought Dorito’s, which she used to put on a sandwich with mayo and country ham when she was younger and in school.

March 14 is also National Pi(e) Day, and I got a close-up view of one at 3:30 in the video above.

What’s your favorite chip? What’s your favorite pi(e)? Let us know in the comments. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Here&rsquo;s some essential information to know if you&rsquo;ve considered buying a new construction property.

 

Amy “The Miracle Maker” Baker splits her time between the resale market and new construction. Since inventory is pretty slim, many are turning to new construction right now. Today she joins me to discuss why you need an experienced agent like her to help you navigate the new construction process.

What are the differences between buying new construction and resale homes?

In a new construction home, you get to choose the design, layout, and finishes that come in that home. With a resale home, you’re inheriting someone else’s home, including their landscaping and neighborhood.

What are the pros and cons of buying new construction?

The timeline for new construction can definitely be a downside; Amy has seen many delays in recent months, sometimes as long as three months!

“If you sign your name into a builder’s registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.”

 What’s the difference between a production builder and a custom builder?

Production builders are cost-conscious; they’ll provide you with a few lot selections, floor plans, and finish packages to choose between. This keeps prices down and buyers from getting overwhelmed by all the options they have.

Custom builders give you a lot more choice over how the house is designed like your flooring, paint colors, trim, hardware, etc., so they involve a bigger time commitment.

What do people need to know about new construction purchases?

When buyers walk into a new construction site, there’s usually a salesperson or site agent there. That agent represents the builder, not you, meaning that if you write that person an offer on the new construction home, they’ll be negotiating for the builder and against you. So if you sign your name into their registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.

That’s why you need to give agents like Amy a call before you begin shopping for homes; she’ll represent your best interests from the beginning to the end of the process.

If you have any questions about new construction, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re happy to stand in your corner to help you achieve your goals.

        <description>

What do women really want on Valentine’s Day? I brought together my favorite group of ladies: my team, Amy, Lisa, and Chloe. I’m going to ask them some questions, and their answers may enlighten you about what women want. 

Do your Valentine’s Day desires fall more in line with Hallmark or HGTV?


  Chloe: Is the food network an option? As long as he’s cooking for me.
  Amy: I like a little romance, but I also like projects. So I would want a pot for cooking, chocolates, perfume, or jewelry. 
  Lisa: For me it’s HGTV; I want those projects done. Make me something pretty.


“I brought together a group of my most favorite ladies in the world: my team.”

What’s the last thing you’d ever want on Valentine’s Day?


  Chloe: I do not want another singing card!
  Amy: Don’t buy me golf clubs; you can get me lessons, but not the actual clubs.
  Lisa: No fishing pole. I don’t want to go fishing, talk about fishing, or shop for fishing lures. 


What’s the perfect Valentine’s Day gift?


  Lisa: Something with whiskers… meow. 
  Chloe: I second that, but also pizza and champagne. 
  Lisa: Or a day trip. Even just shopping and lunch in another town nearby would be great.
  Amy: My family wants another puppy, so that would be the perfect family gift. I would also be happy to cook dinner for everyone.


I want to thank my favorite ladies for gathering to share their thoughts about Valentine’s Day. I hope you learned something, I know I did. Have a happy Valentine’s Day!

What if a fire destroyed your home? What if most of the damaged areas are unrecognizable? How would you prove what personal property was lost? I hope this never happens to you, but I’m sharing some tips for how to create a digital home inventory in case of any disastrous events. 

Theft, fire, and flooding can happen to homeowners. Do you know what you would need to provide to the insurance company to get those items replaced? 

First, using your phone or video camera, walk through your home and videotape each room, including every wall. This way you can show an insurance adjuster what your home looked like before the claim. Then take pictures of electronics, (front and back) with the serial numbers in clear view. Take photos of the appraisals for jewelry, silver, expensive eyeglasses, artwork, tools, and any valuable collectibles.

Remember: Anytime you bring home a new laptop, computer, or anything of value, be sure to snap a photo of the serial number right on the box. Keeping the receipt is a great idea, too. 

Lastly, upload your digital photo album to your online storage service. We use Dropbox, but you could use any photo storage site. Google Photos, iCloud, and Photobucket are common choices. Don’t use Facebook, as we don’t want to give burglars any ideas. 

Don’t forget to add photos to your digital home inventory each time you make a new, inventory-worthy purchase. The more information you provide to the insurance adjuster about a specific item, the better your chances to get it replaced with an item of the same value. Also, while you’re taking photos of your property, make sure to take one of the most valuable things of all: your pet! 

If you have further questions about  digital home inventories or real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to help you.

Happy New Year! I hope the new year is starting out wonderfully for you. You know about New Year’s resolutions, but have you ever considered including your home in them? 

At the beginning of the year, my wife and I make a list of all the things we want to accomplish in or on our house that year. Everything from larger projects like adding a porch, to smaller things like painting a room. Typically, your home is the single largest investment you’ll make. Maintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell. 

I receive calls from people frequently asking what’s the best improvement someone can make to get the highest return on investment. Generally, it’s kitchen and bathroom improvements. At the same time, not all investments will bring the same return. A fence, patio, or a shed, for example, are “use” items, which means you get to use them, but you don’t necessarily get a full return on that investment.

“Maintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell.”

Here’s what I recommend: Once you decide which projects you want to do, write them down. Make sure this list is in a place where you’ll see it regularly. When you see this list on a regular basis, you’ll be more inclined to get those projects done. Also, studies show that writing something down helps you remember it better. 

If you’re concerned about which projects you should do, give me a call or send me an email, I’d be glad to share which project will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Have a fantastic 2020!

        <description>

Today I’m here with Greg Cowart from NFM Lending to help me answer some questions I’ve received lately about mortgage lenders and loan products in the market. But first, what’s so special about NFM Lending?

Greg says, “What makes NFM Lending different from other mortgage companies is that we’re local; I’ve been doing mortgages in Richmond for 18 years. We focus on the purchase process, so we assist people who are buying homes. About 95% of what we do is walking someone through the process of buying a home and all the hurdles that commonly come up. So, when people choose us they’re choosing our experience, we work with a team. They’re choosing the fact that the team is going to give wonderful service all the way through, and they’re also choosing a smaller mortgage model, which allows for greater control and superior results.”

“When searching for the right mortgage lender, when you go with a well-known brand name, you’re also often getting things you don’t want such as bureaucracy, slowness, excuses, and excessive rules. NFM Lending is where a lot of experienced loan officers are going because they allow us to run our branch our way. I have the autonomy to create systems, to hire, to market myself, and create an experience that I wouldn’t get if I worked for one of the big brand name banks.”

“About 95% of what we do is walking someone through the process of buying a home.”

One of the things I appreciate most about Greg is that if a client comes to him and he can’t service them in the correct product, he’ll point them in another direction. 

Another question we get often is, “Are online mortgages something people should consider?”

According to Greg, “Online is an option, we’re seeing many industries moving in that direction. Most mortgages are five to six loan programs. They’re fairly standard from company to company. One of the things you’re accepting when you choose an online lender is their distance. You’re choosing someone who isn’t face-to-face, so you cannot as easily get ahold of them if something happens. Therefore, there’s a bit more lack of accountability. I generally find that the internet lenders don’t have as much experience, and they are also a lot more of a bureaucratic process, where the person you initially talk to may not be the one you work with all the way through. 

“Rocket Mortgage is a brand you may have heard of. They’re one of the first lenders to move heavily into a national online presence and buy heaps of advertising. It’s the same product we offer, it’s just going through an online platform, it’s more of a call center experience. We have the same computer systems, the same easy application process, we just haven’t marketed ourselves that way. At the end of the day they’re in Arizona and Cleveland, they’re not local to your community, Realtor, or client.”

If you have any other questions about NFM Lending or anything else concerning real estate, please reach out to me via phone or email, I would love to help you.

        <description>

I want to share three advantages to listing your home during the holidays:

1. Low inventory. During this time of the year, inventory is especially low, and there are not many admirable homes on the market. Most people wait until the beginning of the year to list their home, so there’s less competition. 

2. Motivated buyers. We don’t have any “window shoppers” out right now—we have buyers.

“During this time of the year, inventory is especially low.”

3. Home presentation. Your home never looks as nice as it does during the holidays. For example, my wife enjoys getting out the holiday decorations and making the house look incredible.

If you’re thinking about selling your house, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be glad to come by and see if it makes sense for you to list your home during the holidays. If you have any questions feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help you in any way I can!

Here’s the thing: I could go on and on about how wonderful our team is, but I’d rather share what some of our past clients have said about us:

Joey and Oliver said, “The team really treats you like family. They are so efficient and very helpful. They’ll take the stress away from buying or selling your home.”

Adeet said, “Amy Baker made sure the deal went smoothly despite some unexpected turns along the way. She was able to refer me to great people in our local area to help out with all aspects of the deal after closing.”

Cindy said, “Mark and his team are incredible. No one likes the process of selling their home, but they made it as painless as possible. They gave me a list of things to do they thought would make my house more attractive to buyers. There was no pressure, and my house sold over asking price in one weekend.”

“Everyone on our team has a passion for helping and serving others.”

George and Nancy said, “They did so much more than sell the house—we never expected the process to be so fast and painless.”

These were just a few people we’ve had the pleasure of serving over the last 20 years. Everyone on our team has a passion for helping and serving others.

If you have any questions about buying, selling, or anything to do with real estate, reach out to us. It truly would be our pleasure to serve you in any way that we can.

        <description>

Many sellers are wondering whether 2019 may be the best time to list their homes, and the truth is that it very well may be. Homes are selling quickly and for top dollar—with homes in good condition often earning more than asking price. 

This is partially thanks to our interest rates, which, after dropping significantly since last year, have made buyers extremely eager to make a move.

However, these conditions won’t last forever. Home prices have been steadily on the rise since 2012, and they’re going to have to stabilize sometime. Experts say that time is drawing near. 

“We can’t be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.”

The bottom line is that now is the time to act. We can’t be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to learn more about how I can help you take advantage of today’s market conditions, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
