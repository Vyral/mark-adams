        <description>

Here’s a quick story about why it’s important to prepare for emergencies.

Today I have a story I wanted to share with you about something that recently happened to a friend of mine. (Disclaimer: Everyone is fine!) 

While my friend was out of town with his family, his house caught on fire. What’s worse is that his pets were stuck inside. Thankfully, the neighbors knew about my friend’s pets, and they were able to get the animals out safely before the fire department arrived. When Lisa and I heard about this, we thought, “Wow, we really need to get in touch with our neighbors!” Lisa reached out to them to ask how many pets they have in their homes, and she let them know how many we have in ours. This exchange of information could be very important if, God forbid, an emergency happened in your neighborhood.

“Always overestimate how much time you will be out of your home so that you can plan your temporary accommodations accordingly.”

Many years ago, Lisa and I had a pipe freeze in our house, and the whole place flooded. We lost nearly everything, including both of our computers, which held so much important data. At the time, cloud storage wasn’t available, but I can tell you now that we make sure to back up our important documents and information regularly. I can’t speak enough about how crucial it is to make sure your vital information is safe from fire or flood. I also encourage you to check out my video about making a digital home inventory, just in case. 

My final tip concerns your insurance company. When our house flooded, the insurance company told us we would be out of our home for about 3 months. It actually turned out to be 10 months! Thankfully, we were renting an apartment with a renewable, month-to-month lease. The bottom line: Always overestimate how much time you will be out of your home so that you can plan your temporary accommodations accordingly.

I hope these tips for preparing your home for a potential emergency are helpful. I wish you all a safe and happy new year, and as always, if you need any assistance with anything real estate-related, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help.

Here are our tips for maintaining and refreshing your home in 2022. 

Happy New Year! It’s the time of year when everyone is making a list of what they want to get done with their home, and I have some great tips to help you accomplish your goals. Lisa and I do this exercise every year, so we want to go over how we revive our home:

1. Wipe down your shower after every use. This will prevent mold from building up, so you won’t have to remove it later. 

2. Re-caulk your shower. Unfortunately, wiping down your shower won’t prevent the caulk from turning yellow. If you replace the caulk, you’d be surprised how new your shower will look. 

3. Spray your glass shower door with Rain-X every three months. This will prevent water and soap scum from sticking to your shower door. It will look brand-new all year round. 

4. Change your home decor every three months. Lisa changes our decor based on the season. Her tip for you is that instead of buying new pillows, she simply buys new pillowcases. This way, we get a fresh, seasonal look without breaking the bank.

“Subtle changes to your home can make it really pop. ”

5. Replace the front door mat regularly. These things don’t last as long as you’d think. If your mat is looking old, consider replacing it. 

6. Replace the mailbox and replace the post. It’s subtle, but little things like this can make a big impact on your home. 

7. Replace the pots for houseplants, and replace your picture frames. This tip is similar to changing pillowcases. You can make the details of your home seem new and exciting just by changing how they’re framed. 

8. Make sure the lightbulbs are the same type and color. This will make your home appear more cohesive.

9. Install switch plate covers. This way, you don’t have to replace the receptacle ever again. The convenience switch plate covers offer is unmatched. 

Hopefully, these tips gave you some ideas on how to breathe new life into your home in 2022. If you have a tip you’d like to share with me, leave it in the chat or send me an email. I’d love to share it with everyone else!

Here are some of our biggest highlights from a jam-packed 2021. 

Happy holidays! Lisa and I love this time of year because it gives us an opportunity to reflect on what we’ve accomplished. Not only that, but we learn from what we did to make next year even better. 

For example, one of our goals for 2021 was to build Lisa an amazing garden, and we accomplished it. Lisa wanted us to eat better, and our garden has been providing us with tons of vegetables. Since we share, all our neighbors are pretty happy with us, too!

If you’re like me, then you remember all those great meals you had as a kid that you  haven’t had in a long time. I wanted to spend more time with my mom this year, so I started going over to her home for dinner more often. We had some of the classic food from my childhood, but we tried some excellent new dishes, as well. 

I also had to go on many business trips this year. Typically, I do what I need to do for business and leave, but this year, I made an effort to explore each new area I visited. For example, I went hiking in Arizona, and the terrain was unlike anything I had seen before.

“Teaching shop has been the highlight of my week ever since I started doing it.”

Usually, Lisa and I aren’t big spenders, but I had been talking recently about how I wanted a new truck. When she took her truck to the dealership to be serviced, she found almost exactly what I had been looking for, and she surprised me with the vehicle when she came home. This wasn’t on our list of goals, but it was an awesome surprise and certainly a highlight of the year. 

Something that’s important to me and Lisa is service. Recently, I had the opportunity to help teach a shop class for a local school. I was super excited, and it’s been the highlight of my week ever since I started doing it. Helping kids learn something I love has been incredibly rewarding, and I look forward to teaching the class in the future. 

As we look forward to 2022, one of the highlights for Lisa and I will be our 32-year wedding anniversary. It’s hard to believe it’s been that long, but I’ve loved spending my life with her. 

However, that’s enough about us; let us know what you are looking forward to in 2022. Just give us a call or shoot us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

        <title>A Real Estate Market Update to Round Out 2021</title>

Here’s a brief end-of-year real estate market update for Central Virginia.

As we head toward the end of the year, I’m sharing how our real estate market is doing and where we’re headed in 2022. We’re going directly into the Central Virginia Regional MLS to look at some of the latest numbers.

Let’s start with the average sale price. At the beginning of 2021, it was at $321,733. It precipitously rose through the middle of the year, and we hit a high of $367,966 in the summer before dropping back down later into the year. Right now, it sits right around $359,000. 

The bottom line is that our lack of inventory is the cause behind these price increases. In January 2020, we sold 4,001 homes. In January 2021, we sold only 2,126. The big reason behind this is that there just weren’t as many homes available for buyers to purchase. That drove prices up, and that inventory doesn’t look like it will go back up anytime soon.

We don’t know where the market is going, but we do know that it’s definitely changing. The list-to-sale price ratio measures what homes have sold for compared to their original list prices. In January, we were a little over 100%. Then in May, we jumped up to 104%. Then it started to gradually go down, and now we’re at 101.5%. That’s a tell-tale sign of the market softening and changing. I don’t know where it’s going, but I do know one thing: Sale prices are very strong.

“If you’re a buyer, you can still take advantage of rates in the 3.2% range.”

Here’s the thing: I believe we’ll see the same type of activity as we go into 2022 based on the fact that there still aren’t a lot of available properties for sale. If you’re a seller, the positive is that you’re probably going to get a very high price for your house. We have data that shows it’s a great time to get your home sold for top dollar. If you’re a buyer, you can still take advantage of rates in the 3.2% range.

If you’re looking to sell and buy, how can you set it up so you’re successful? We’ve had a lot of success selling properties off-market. We found buyers for many of our sellers without having to put their homes on the market. These buyers can meet the seller’s needs in price and flexibility to give them the time to find their new home. This situation puts you in a great position as a buyer because your home is already sold. 

If you’re thinking about selling, I’d be happy to do a Comparitive Market Analysis and let you know what your home is worth today. I might already have a buyer in my back pocket who can give you what you’re looking for.

If you have any questions about these numbers, the market, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Here’s why we’re so thankful for you as we reflect on this past year.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! Words aren’t enough to express my gratitude for all of you, but I’m going to try.

Lisa and I sit down every year around this time and think about the biggest blessings that have come our way over the last year. The last 12 months have been weird at best, and we know many business owners that are unfortunately no longer in business. 

Because of you, not only did we have a great year, but we thrived in this strange environment. We can’t thank you enough for your support. There are people that work for us who rely on us and have families, and there are other real estate-adjacent companies that rely on us as well. All of them have been positively affected by you and your trust in us.

“Your trust and support mean the world to us.”

We know how emotional it is to buy a house. It’s typically the single biggest investment you’ll ever make. Lisa has told me many stories of watching kids growing up in houses and it always brings us back to the time that we got to serve them. We love seeing the pictures and posts of your families on social media. Some of those young kids are now buying homes with us or referring us to their other family members and friends. 

For the past 21 years, most of our business has been referral-based. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for that. If you need anything from us, real estate or not, feel free to reach out because we would absolutely love an opportunity to serve you in any way possible. We hope you have an amazing holiday season!

        <description>

MLS data is showing us that we’re likely near the peak of the market.&lt;/p.

&nbsp;

I get asked a lot about when we’ll know if we’re reaching the peak of this market. I have some statistics from our regional MLS that I want to share with you. I think they give us some idea of where the market’s headed:

**Average sales price.** In January of 2020, the average sales price was around $295,000. In January of 2021, the average sales price was $321,000. In September, the average sales price reached $357,000.

**Homes for sale.** In January of 2020, there were 4,000 homes available. In January of 2021, there were only 2,000. Inventory is really low. In September of 2021, there were still only 2,000 available, when there should normally be 4,000. That's why we continue to see prices go up.

**Days on market.** We had 49 days in January of 2020, 25 days in January of 2021, and 15 days in September of 2021. As far as days on market, it almost halved every step there. That's amazing, right?

&#8220;I think we’re very close to a peak in the market.&#8221;

**Average list-to-sales price ratio.** This is the statistic that I believe will show us where the market is going. In January of 2020, the average list-to-sales price ratio was 97.5%. In January of 2021, it was 100.2%. In September of 2021, it was almost 102%. However, in May of 2021, it was 104% and declined from then on. I believe that's a tell-tale sign that the market has started to change.

About two months ago, I noticed that we were having fewer showings and offers at the same locations and at the same prices. Those are all signs of buyer fatigue. Buyers are tired and fed up. It's a natural market cycle. Have we hit the peak? I think we're very close to it, but now's still a great time to sell your house for top dollar.

If you're thinking about selling or if you want to know the value of your house, feel free to give me a call. I'd love to help you look at your neighborhood data and learn what's going on to see if you can still sell at or above market value. I look forward to hearing from you.

Watch as Greg Cowart rappels down the Dominion Power building.

&nbsp;

As you know, we recently participated in the Richmond SPCA’s “Over the Edge” fundraiser to raise money for the animals in our community. Those who reached the $2,500 fundraising goal were entered into the “Toss Your Boss” contest - if you hit a certain goal, you got to send your boss over the edge of the second tallest building in RVA. 

We reached and surpassed our goal! With your help, we raised $2,874. Lisa surpassed the team goal, guaranteeing herself a rappelling spot, but we decided it would be more fun to raffle Lisa’s spot off instead. We held a client and vendor appreciation event in July, and anyone who donated at least $25 was entered into the raffle. 

The winner of the raffle was Jesse Perrone, who works with our preferred lender, Greg Cowart of NFM Lending. (You might remember Greg from our pumpkin taste test video.) Instead of using the ticket for herself, Jesse decided she wanted to toss HER boss. The funny part was that she didn’t tell him! Instead, she put a lunch date with his wife on his calendar.

“With your help, we raised $2,874.”

He is always able to improvise quickly, and takes surprises very well. Check out the video above, starting at 0:54, where we tell Greg that he’s the lucky winner and see footage of him rappelling down the massive edifice. We’d like to give him a special shout-out for not only being a great and trusted lender, but a great sport, too.

If you have any real estate-related questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Here are my top three methods for finding a great contractor.

&nbsp;

Let me guess: You need a contractor ASAP, but everyone you’ve called is already booked. Don’t worry. Here are three tips to help you find a great contractor:

1. Referrals. Reach out to your list of contacts, neighbors, and even people you know on facebook. If they’ve had contract work done recently, ask them about it. Was it done on time? Did they show up on time? Did they charge a reasonable price? These questions will help you get a feel for the contractor. Then, once you reach out to them, make sure they are licensed and insured. Every job is different, so depending on the work, licensing and insurance could be crucial. 

“If you need work done on your home, chances are I can refer you to a reliable contractor. ”

2. Call the supply house and talk to sales. Let me give you an example: When I renovated my house about eight years ago, the trim contractor I usually worked with wasn’t available. I called the lumber house, asked for their top salesperson, and asked them who they would recommend for trim carpeting. The contractor they recommended did a fantastic job, and I still refer him to my clients today. This story just goes to show, if you talk to the top salespeople in an industry, they can probably refer you to an excellent contractor. 

3. Talk to me. As you can imagine, I keep in touch with contractors pretty regularly as part of my job. If you need work done on your home, chances are I can refer you to a reliable contractor. 

Thanks a ton for visiting my blog. If you have any questions about today’s topic, or if you need a great contractor, please reach out to me via phone or email. I am always willing to help.

Find out how we adopted our new dog, Wilma.

&nbsp;

It’s been 9 months now since Sadie passed away, and we’ve been talking about getting another dog. Lisa’s really big on the adoption process, so I just wanted to share a bit about how we ended up adopting Wilma. We were expecting it to be easy, but it really wasn’t.

We went to about three different rescues, and they all do it differently. At some agencies, you have to find a dog you want before you fill out the application. For others, you’d fill out an application and they’d match you with a dog, and this was what we did for Wilma.

This time around it was pretty emotional. The rescue had matched us with Wilma, and we only had a certain amount of time to respond to get our appointment. By the time Lisa had seen the email, it was too late, and we’d missed the chance to meet her. That was tough. 

“I thought adopting a dog would be easy, but it wasn’t.”

Lucky for us, the other people had to cancel their appointment, so we got another chance to adopt Wilma! We learned from her foster mother, Brenda, who volunteers with Lab Rescue LRCP, that Wilma came in as an abandoned pup in pretty bad shape with her little sister Betty.

We’re super excited to have her, and we can’t wait to see what the cats think!

As you might already know, we recently made a commitment to raise funds for the Richmond SPCA. You partnered with us to help exceed our goal. We raised $2,844! Thank you so much for your generosity. Now we are making a different kind of commitment, one that will give us years of joy and companionship, by adopting Wilma!

As always, feel free to reach out to us with any real estate question you might have.

Having pets in your home shouldn’t preclude you from a successful sale.

&nbsp;

Does having a dog or cat in your house while it’s on the market affect its saleability? In my opinion, yes, but here are a few suggestions to help you sell a home while having pets:

1. Neutralize the house the best you can. Remember that you get to decide when buyers actually go inside your property. Lisa and I have previously sold homes that had dogs and cats living in them, so we know that when you have animals, they’ll probably leave unwanted messes on the carpet every once in a while, and it’s important to take away those buyer objections. Also, get rid of any food/water bowls, toys, litter boxes, and clean the cat litter closet so there’s no evidence that animals live in the house. You want to set the stage when buyers walk through the door and, as I mentioned, take away any objections they may have. 

2. On showing days, remove your pets from the house. I know this isn’t always possible, especially if you’re at work and somebody wants to see your home. Sometimes we see sellers leave their dogs in a kennel or leave a note saying that their cat is in the house somewhere. It just depends on your situation. In a perfect scenario, though, I always say remove any animals from the house. I’ve been to showings with buyers who refused to take a good look at a house because a dog was inside and they were more concerned about that. Seeing this made me concerned enough to share this advice with my seller clients. If there’s any way you can get your pets out of the house during a showing, do it. 

“Even with animals, you can make your house look amazing.”

3. Have a friend, family member, or your Realtor do a sniff test of your home. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing that your house smells like an animal lives there, but other people might not find it very pleasant. If it does, shampoo the carpet, clean the floors the best you can, and stick some scented plugins into the walls. 

4. Remove dog waste from the yard. Buyers will want to take a look around, and if they see a bunch of droppings scattered about, that’s a big-time negative. 

Here’s the thing: Even with animals, you can make your house look amazing. You’re not trying to lie to buyers. You’re just trying to neutralize the house as much as possible so that when they come, you’re setting a positive stage instead of a negative one. 

If you’d like to know more about getting your house in the best shape possible so you sell for top dollar, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you in any way I can.

        <description>

Here is your market update comparing data from 2020 to 2021.

&nbsp;

Today I want to give you a market update on what we’ve been seeing in the last 12 months. The information I’m sharing with you is coming directly out of the Central Virginia Multiple Listing Service. Let’s dive in!

Back in May of 2020, the median sales price was $265,000, and in May of 2021, it was up to $297,000 (a 12.3% increase!). Property values typically only go up by about 3% to 5% per year. That’s a seriously big jump! Single-family homes are up from $268,000 to $303,000 and condos went from $249,000 to $263,000.

“It’s still a really good time to put your house on the market.”

From May of 2020 to May of 2021, the average days on market has gone from 34 days down to 24 days, which is down by 29%. Homes have been selling quicker!

The percent of the original list price received in May of last year was 98.4%. The average is now 101%. If you’re a seller right now, you’re basically guaranteed to get your sales price. It’s still a really good time to put your house on the market.

Buyers, I know that some of you are discouraged about jumping into the market right now. All the industry experts are saying that property values are going to continue along this trajectory. One of the contributing factors to the continuing rising prices is that 70% of all homeowners right now have 50% or more equity in their houses. 38% of all homeowners actually have their houses paid off. That means that if something happens and they need to sell, they’re not going to lose money because they have so much equity. Even though it’s hard to get in the market right now, it may be even harder next year because property values are going to go up. Right now, you can take advantage of low interest rates.

Last year in May, we had 3,172 homes on the market. Now there are only 1,669. That’s down by 47%. Right now,  a lot of first-time homebuyers are flooding the market, and there aren’t as many people of the last generation who are selling their houses. That’s what’s creating the supply and demand issue.

Last year in May, our months of inventory was at 1.9 months. Now we’re down to just a month of inventory. This data is again telling us that if you’re a seller, it’s probably a really good time to get your house on the market and get the most money out of it.

If you have any questions or if you’re interested in knowing what your property value is, feel free to give us a call. We would love to help you out in any way that we can. Have a great day.

Here’s why we’re partnering with the SPCA to raise funds for local animals.

&nbsp;Here are our fundraising pages with our stories and links to donate:Lisa&rsquo;s PageMark&rsquo;s Page

Today I am coming to you to talk about a cause that is near and dear to our hearts: animals. As you may know, we lost our sweet dog Sadie in November to cancer. We wanted to do something to honor her memory because she meant so much to us. 

Sadie was my garage and fishing buddy and she was Lisa’s best friend and garden helper. She was also a great friend to our cats: Clara, Fuller and Eli. She is greatly missed by our whole family.

To honor Sadie’s memory, Lisa and I decided to take part in the SPCA’s Over the Edge challenge and raise funds for the animals they care for.

Supporting the SPCA is a natural fit for us, but we really need your help and encouragement to reach our goals. You’ve always helped us support pet causes in a big way. Since 2009, you’ve donated around 15,000 pounds of pet food to our Meals on Wheels pet food drives, which provide meals for the pets of the seniors who receive meals from FeedMore.

“On average, an animal spends 22 days at the SPCA before being adopted.”

Lisa recently took a behind-the-scenes tour of the SPCA and was amazed at all they do to care for the pets there who are waiting for their forever homes. She visited the dog kennels and fell in love with a pit bull named Adam, saw the cat infirmary, the animal hospital, the adoption rooms, the laundry facilities, and even the bath stations. Check them out in the video above. She told me how clean it was and how good it smelled. For Lisa to say that, it really means something.

When you partner with us, your support will go directly towards caring for the dogs, cats and other creatures the SPCA takes in year after year. On average, an animal spends 22 days at the SPCA before being adopted.

Did you know that it costs $17 a day to care for each animal? A donation of just $25 provides bottle feeding for four infant kittens for two weeks and a $125 donation can pay the adoption fee for a senior pet, and you know how we love helping the seniors in our community.

With your donation, you may be helping a friend or family member’s next dog or cat in the process. As you can see, your support means a lot. You can make a huge difference by providing a day, a week, or even a month’s worth of care with your gift. 

We want to save them all, but we know we can only reach our goal with your love, support and encouragement. Please help us exceed our goals to make Sadie proud. Every dollar helps.

If you have any questions for us, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

We&rsquo;re sending you the Homebot app, so here are some of its great features.

&nbsp;

Do you want to know what your home is worth? Do you want to know how much equity you have in your house? I can provide those answers for free right now. For years, my team and I have been researching companies for an app that we could send to our clients for free that would tell them the value of their homes. We finally found it, and it’s called Homebot. 

Here are a few of its great features:

1. Home value. One tap shows you the value of your home. The app may not know about your home’s amenities, so you can also adjust the value higher or lower based on what your home includes. 

2. Your equity position. By the time the average American retires, 83% of their wealth comes from home equity. Homebot helps you keep track of your equity position.

3. Amortization chart. This tells you how much you would save on interest if you made extra mortgage payments. Personalized calculations can help you save money and pay off your loans quicker.

“This app has so many cool features that we think you’ll enjoy exploring.”

Officer Mashburn is back to discuss CPTED and keeping your home safe.

&nbsp;

Today our special guest is back by popular demand: Officer Mashburn. The last time she joined us, she talked a bit about environmental design, and we thought it was fascinating, so she’s back to share more about it. 

CPTED is the term used within the police department, and it stands for Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design. It’s based on the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can lead to a reduction in fear of crime and improvement in quality of life. 

“Lighting shows ownership.”

Many things are included in CPTED, but one of the most crucial is natural surveillance or landscaping. For example, homeowners should keep shrubs and trees maintained around their homes so they can see all parts of their house as they walk up to it from the street. Let’s say you have a large bush next to your house—if you keep it maintained, there’s less opportunity for someone to hide behind it. (Who knew the police had strategic ways they could tell us to landscape to keep safe!)

Lighting is another essential aspect, and we call it territorial reinforcement. Lighting shows ownership, and there are four main factors to it: the proper amount, high visibility low-glare, uniformity, and fixture type. Regarding uniformity, whatever lighting is chosen for the front, back, or sides of the home, we recommend that it illuminate that entire part of the house; we don’t want to see pockets of darkness. When choosing fixtures, ensure they direct light downward—don’t waste light by directing it horizontally, as that doesn’t cover anything. 

We look forward to having Officer Mashburn back again in the future. If you have any questions or real estate needs, please reach out to us via phone or email. We would love to help you.

Here&rsquo;s how our team can help you make more from your home sale.

&nbsp;

It’s an incredibly hot market right now, and it has some people wondering if they even need an agent in order to sell their homes. Though it’s possible to sell on your own, I highly recommend against it.

First of all, we build relationships. Most of our business comes through referrals, and we often work with past clients as well as their friends and family members. It speaks for itself—over the past 20 years, we’ve provided such great service that people consistently return or bring in others for us to serve. If we didn’t do a good job, we wouldn’t be getting that repeat business.

That’s not the only thing we offer; we also provide monetary value. Homes are getting so many offers nowadays that it can be difficult to determine which one is the best. The craziness of our market has created a lot of strange situations when it comes to offers, and we have the professional expertise to sift through and figure out which one works well for your needs.

“The bottom line is that our team holds an incredible amount of knowledge that allows sellers to find exactly what they need.”

Here’s a quick story that illustrates how we can help you: One of our best clients recently referred a friend to us. This new client was doing a for-sale-by-owner listing, and her property was in fantastic shape—however, her price tag was about $20,000 too high. It wasn’t selling, so we met with her to see what was going on and discovered that the photography was terrible. Additionally, her emotional investment in the home meant she was unable to make objective decisions when it came to offers. 

We came in, figured out what her home should actually be priced at, and took good pictures for the listing. Her property sold the very next week, and at a higher price than she could have gotten on her own.

The bottom line is that our team holds an incredible amount of knowledge that allows sellers to find exactly what they need. If you’d like to learn more about what we can do for your situation, or if you have any questions about real estate, feel free to reach out to us. Every situation is different and we strive to make the selling process as enjoyable and stress free as possible. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Don&rsquo;t sell yourself short by waiting to put your home on the market. 

&nbsp;

We’re in the middle of a market I’ve never seen before in my two decades of real estate. Sellers are at a unique advantage as buyers are using enticing ways to get their offers accepted. We’re selling homes for well above asking price, and even having appraisal and inspection contingencies waived. 

You might be thinking, “Sure, that sounds amazing, but WHERE am I going to go if I sell my house right now?” I’m getting this question left and right, so I wanted to propose an option. Stick with me while I explain why you should simply move out. Your next dream home may not be available yet, but I have three reasons why you may not want to wait for it to come along to sell your current house. I know the idea of temporary housing doesn’t sound the most appealing, but I’ll tell you why it might be worth it to you. 

“Sellers are at a unique advantage as buyers are using enticing ways to get their offers accepted.”

First, we’re seeing homes sell for $10,000, $20,000, even $40,000 over the asking price. That alone is motivating people to list now. Beyond that, sellers are getting those prices without making any updates, which brings me to my second reason to sell now: Buyers are so eager right now they are willing to forgo inspections and/or they are waiving repairs. We’ve seen it happen with the last three of our contracts. This is saving sellers money and the headache of having contractors in and out of their house. I’ll leave you with the third and perhaps greatest reason to move right now: The proceeds from the sale will put you in the BEST possible cash position to buy your dream home. And isn’t that the goal?

If you’d like to know what your home could sell for in this market, or you have questions about temporary housing options, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

Lisa Adams joins me to teach us about winter sowing.

Lisa joined me today to share the next phase in her vision for our suburban garden. Since we don’t have a ton of land to farm on, she brought the idea of winter sowing to me, which is so easy to do, we just had to share it with you. Check out Lisa’s step-by-step demonstration in the video above.

So, what is the difference between winter sowing and winter growing, you ask? Winter sowing is essentially making a mini greenhouse to support seeds while they germinate during the wintertime. This differs from winter growing, where you plant directly into the ground or utilize a greenhouse or cold frame, in order to produce vegetables that are harvested in the wintertime. What’s great about winter sowing is that you probably already have most of the materials you need at home, aside from the seeds and potting soil, and it takes up very little room in your yard. The process is simple – you put your seeds in soil in a plastic milk jug, seal it, and then put it outside and wait for them to sprout. Then, come springtime, your plants are ready to go in the ground to flourish. The beets, radishes, and broccoli Lisa planted a couple weeks ago are already beginning to grow!

If you’d like to learn more about this method of growing, here is the Facebook group Lisa belongs to.

If you have any questions about real estate or would like more ideas for home projects like this, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

Here&rsquo;s how to get an accurate valuation of your home.

&nbsp;

Sellers: Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, Redfin, and every other estimated home value website out there is inaccurate. Heck, even your tax assessor’s office is inaccurate when it comes to valuating your home. Why? Because they use computer-automated programs to estimate its value.  

First and foremost, there are many factors that determine a home’s value—location, style, amenities, school district, etc. Knowing this, I’ll give you an example of how automated systems can make mistakes. Let’s say there are two houses, House A and House B, from the same neighborhood that were built at the same time (20 years ago) and are the same size: 2,000 square feet. The only difference between them is that House A recently had its kitchen and bathrooms updated and was sold about two years ago. House B, meanwhile, has never been resold since it was built and doesn’t have any upgrades. 

“If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared.”

When an automated system focuses on a certain area, it incorporates all the recent sales data. If it doesn’t know what House B initially sold for, it will use the data from nearby homes that have sold recently. If House A has upgrades, it stands to reason that it’s worth more than House B, but an automated assessment will give House B a higher value. Unfortunately, many people trust these assessments despite the fact that they’re wildly inaccurate. 

So how can you accurately calculate your home’s worth? Say hello to your friendly neighborhood Realtor! If you give me a call, I’ll come to your house, take lots of notes, and compare it to other houses based on all the factors I’ve shared. The thing is, I haven’t seen a real estate market like this in 20 years, and I’m not just saying that. There is very little inventory, and sellers are cashing in on the fact that interest rates are also very low, which means there are a lot of buyers but not enough houses for them all. 

If you’re considering selling your house in the next six to seven months, call me today so I can give you the very best estimate of its value. If you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s my recent project of trying the Japanese Shou Sugi Ban technique.

&nbsp;

Over the holidays, my wife Lisa asked me to build some raised beds for her new garden, and they turned out well. However, when I was done, she said they looked bright and new and wondered whether there was any way to treat them to make them appear weathered. She did some internet research and found out about an ancient Japanese technique called Shou Sugi Ban where you lightly char the wood to preserve it.  This technique is not only for garden beds, but any wood-working project, such as sheds, cabinets, etc.

“We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully.”

So, I went to Lowe’s and found an excellent torch tool that’s designed to burn weeds but works well with this technique. The torch cost about $55, was easy to use, and the tank of gas cost $25. I’m not a Shou Sugi Ban expert, but here are a few safety tips if you decide to try this project at home:


  Wear a good pair of safety glasses.
  Wear a secure pair of safety gloves.
  Stay away from the tank when you’re burning. This torch throws out a large flame, and you don’t want any explosions happening!


We think these garden beds turned out wonderfully. Watch me using the Shou Sugi Ban technique starting at 1:00 in the video above. 

If you have any questions about how I made these garden beds or concerning real estate, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to share this technique with you. Arigato!

        <description>

Here&rsquo;s why the highest offer isn&rsquo;t always the best one.

&nbsp;

In a multiple-offer situation, why is the highest offer not always the best?

For our listings, we regularly see multiple-offer situations where buyers compete with each other to the point that they’re making offers above asking price. The problem with this is that in their contract, the buyer has the option to order an appraisal. The contract also states that if the home doesn’t appraise at the written sale price, they have three options:


  Ask the seller to reduce their price to the appraised value. 
  Negotiate a price somewhere in between
  Ask to be let out of the contract (if the first two options fail)


My team and I recently listed a property that snagged seven offers. The top two offers were $30,000 and $23,000 above asking price. The buyer behind the second offer, though, negotiated up front with the sellers that they would pay the difference between the written sale price and appraised value if it happened to be less. That was huge, and the buyer behind the first offer didn’t include that kind of contingency in it, which meant if the home didn’t appraise, they’d have a problem on their hands. When we did a comparative market analysis of the area, we discovered that the price that buyer offered didn’t support the comps, so that was likely where their deal would’ve ended up. In this case, the second buyer clearly had the better offer. 

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or would like to know what your home is worth in today’s market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.

Friends and Clients —

The real estate market continues to surge ahead. However, clouds might be forming on the horizon for sellers. Let me give you the details:

1. Ultra-low mortgage rates

Throughout 2020, the popular 30-year fixed mortgage rate set 15 new record lows. 

It ended 2020 just one basis point higher than the latest record low and currently stands at 2.86%, a full percentage point lower than one year ago.

These ultra-low mortgage rates are driving an increase in demand. Unfortunately, sales are restricted due to…

2. Record-low inventory

There were just 1.28 million homes available for sale at the end of November, the last month for which we have full data.

That is down 22% from a year earlier. It is also the lowest inventory count since the National Association of Realtors began tracking this metric in 1982.

Unsurprisingly, home prices are shooting up thanks to strong demand and record low inventory.

The median price of an existing home sold in November was a staggering 14.6% higher than in November 2019.

If you’re worried this pace is unsustainable, you might be right:

3. A change in the market?

Some experts warn that home prices are overheating and that affordability is suffering.

They might have a point because, after five consecutive months of gains, closed sales of existing homes lowered in November. 

Similarly, after three straight months of record highs, homebuilder confidence in December dropped 4%. December mortgage applications also fell. 

So what does this all mean for you?

Well, things might get harder soon for home sellers.

Lower affordability could hurt demand, and the price growth we’ve seen over the past months might slow down, or prices might decrease like we started to see before the pandemic.

Fortunately, nationwide trends haven’t caught up to us yet in Richmond.

Demand is still very strong. If you were to list now, you could sell quickly and at top dollar.

If you’d like to get an idea of what your home is worth right now, you can use the following home value calculator, which is based on recent Richmond sales:

If you are considering selling while the current market lasts, give me a call at 804.237.8585. I’ve helped many people sell in these pandemic circumstances, and I’m here to answer your questions and help however I can.

If you have a friend or family member thinking about selling it would be my pleasure to earn their business. Don’t hesitate to call me and I promise to take great care of them.  

Have a great day,

Mark Adams

You may not be superstitious, but we’re at least a little ‘stitious!

We got together as a team to celebrate another successful year in business, in spite of all the curveballs 2020 threw our way. Although it was a great year for many reasons, you might be as happy as we are to say “good riddance!” to 2020. As our mindsets shift toward 2021, we want to bring about all the good fortune possible, so we reminisced on some superstitions from our childhoods. We figure that 2021 may need as many of these good-luck charms and superstitions as it can get, so we went ahead and performed a whole mess of them!

To start, Mark’s mom always prepared black-eyed peas to eat on New Year’s to bring good luck. He also eats an apple every day to keep the doctor away (would you call that luck or science?). Also, picking up pennies is something he still does to this day.

Chloe also recalls tossing pennies into a fountain as a kid for good luck, and on the first day of every month, she recites the words “bunny, bunny, bunny”—a twist on the classic “rabbit, rabbit, rabbit” superstition.

“People in Spain toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass, symbolizing 12 months of good luck for the new year.”

Rabbits are also a part of Amy’s good luck traditions. She carries a rabbit’s foot to rub for good luck, with much success; it’s brought about some clutch UVA basketball wins and even a surprise baby!

Lisa has a horseshoe from her grandfather that symbolizes luck, and tosses salt over her shoulder. She also knocks on wood, which is something you might do all the time, too, but do you know why? In Irish folklore, evil spirits live in the wood, so you must knock on it to deafen their ears to your wishes.

Lastly, we all decided to cheers to the new year. As it turns out, Spaniards toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass; each one is to be eaten to symbolize 12 months of good luck in the upcoming year.

Here’s to your good fortune in 2021! If we can help you with that, at least by way of your real estate needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Happy holidays to you and yours, and adios, 2020!

Officer Mashburn shares some simple but important tips for holiday safety.

‘Tis the season to be jolly! Let’s prevent some criminal folly.

We stole some of Officer Mashburn’s time, but we promise it was for a good cause. She joined us to answer some questions about deterring crime during the holiday season. Curious what you could take away from her message? Check out our brief interview in the video above to learn some great tips on protecting your deliveries from “porch pirates,” as well as protecting yourself, your home, and your vehicle.

If you’re just looking for quick tips to snatch ‘n grab, here are the highlights:


  
    Leave special instructions for delivery drivers for where to place your packages; ask that they hide them behind outdoor furniture or leave them at a side door where they are less visible.
  
  
    Keep all of your doors/windows locked at all times! 
  
  
    Don’t leave valuables (shopping bags, presents, etc.) in your car. Take them inside.
  
  
    Leave your lights on, especially your outdoor lights. Sure, it might run up your electric bill, but on the plus side, Santa will have no problem finding your house!
  


Special thanks to Officer Mashburn for spending time with us and for serving our communities. Even during this busy time of year, we’ll be here to help with any real estate needs you may have. Happy holidays, and stay safe, friends!

The Mark Adams Team is grateful for so many things this year.

With the holidays approaching, it’s a great time to pause and reflect on what we’re grateful for. Today I’m joined by my favorite people, my team, to share what we’re thankful for this holiday season.

Amy is thankful to have been able to spend a lot more time at home with her family this year. She has also gotten to enjoy decorating her new home in Wintergreen. Her children have been very productive in making ornaments for their Christmas tree at the mountain house. These talented kiddos need their own Etsy account!

Chloe is grateful for many things that came from quarantine. She’s gotten to fulfill her dream of being a stay-at-home mom while also having a job—the best of both worlds. She’s also thankful for all the educators who have taken an impossible situation and made the best of it. Although homeschooling is challenging, she is glad to have a more active role in Joie’s education.

“We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.”

Fall is Lisa’s favorite time of the year, and is grateful that she’s had the opportunity to spend lots of time with her animals in 2020. She’s thankful for her health and the ability to work from home with her husband (thanks to noise-canceling headphones). She was also given an unusual blessing in the fact that her brother and his family were able to spend more time with their mother, who passed away recently. The hospital allowed his whole family to be there with her, which isn’t typical these days. Also, Lisa is grateful for being able to spend time with friends over Zoom, take walks, and settle into a good book.

As for me, I’m thankful for my friends and family members. This time in quarantine has also given me an opportunity to not only spend more time at home, but also to enjoy the amazing garden my wife created where she’s grown some impressive pumpkins! One of the most critical lessons we’ve learned during quarantine is how important it is to be around people. Our team has missed meeting in person on a regular basis, so we really appreciate this time we’ve had together today.

Last, but not least, we’re all thankful for you! We’re so grateful for being able to serve such amazing people like yourselves. We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.

What are you thankful for this year? Reach out to us and let us know—we’d love to hear about it!

In honor of fall, we’re (blindly) sampling savory pumpkin-flavored treats.

You may have heard of Blind Melon; please welcome Blind Pumpkin to the stage—a blind pumpkin taste test, that is! ‘Tis the season for all things pumpkin spice. We decided to take a break from work and go ALL in. Our buddy, Greg Cowart of NFM Lending, joined Mark and Amy to sample a spread of pumpkin-flavored novelties dished out by Lisa and Chloe (who may have snuck in some mind games). Check out this video to see our reactions, reviews, and see which of us has the sharpest palette.  And now that the sugar coma has worn off, we’re back to work, so don’t hesitate to give us a shout for your real estate needs!

As always, thanks for watching!

Given the market, should you stay in your home and refinance or just sell it?

Should you stay in your current house and refinance or should you prepare to sell it because the market is so attractive for sellers right now? 

There are a couple of questions you’ll need to ask yourself before you can make this decision:


  How long will I stay in the area? 
  What does it cost to refinance?


Once you have the answers to those questions, choosing which path is right for you should be a little easier.

Now let’s talk about the refinancing process. A good rule of thumb is that if you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance. Typically, there are fees associated with refinancing. To find out what those fees are, just ask your mortgage company for a good faith estimate. That will have a list of all the fees associated with refinancing.

“If you can get a good interest rate that’s 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance.”

Suppose that it’s going to cost $2,000 to refinance your house. In this scenario, you’ll get a 1% reduction in your interest rate, so you’d save $100 a month on your mortgage if you do refinance. In this case, it would take you 20 months to pay off the $2,000 investment. Ask yourself if it makes sense to even invest your money right now if it’ll take that long to recoup. It might make more sense to use that money to fix your house up so that when you get ready to sell in two or three years, you’ll get top dollar for it. It just depends on your situation.

If you’re still not sure about which path is right for you, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to share my advice about what exactly you can do to your house to get the biggest bang for your buck. I can also give you guidance about whether it makes sense to refinance your house instead. It’s my pleasure to help you.

        <description>

Here’s how we’re helping other small businesses in our community grow.

Lisa and I started our business 21 years ago, and we quickly learned we had no idea how to run a small business. 

I sought out information at a real estate conference, where I met a coach who told me something that has stuck with me after all these years: “If you’re going to be a business owner, you need to make personal growth a part of your routine for the rest of your life.” 

“We will be offering training, networking, and much more.”

Two years later, I met another speaker who introduced me to the idea of masterminding. I learned how important it is to seek out other business owners in my field so that we can share experiences and learn from one another with the common goal of elevating ourselves and our industry. 

That’s the purpose of the group I started on Facebook, Intentional Business Owners of RVA. We will be offering training on business and personal growth, networking opportunities, and promoting your business connections via individual spotlights. If you are a small business owner, or know someone who is, we would love to have you be a part of our new community.

        <description>Have you been thinking about what your home is worth lately?I wanted to let you know Richmond home prices are not dropping in spite of the seemingly never ending curve balls 2020 is throwing.

In fact, while inventory is down 40% nationally since sellers are likely hesitant to have buyers walk through their home, home prices are still strong (if not stronger).

Would you like to know what your home here in Richmond is worth for free? Call me at 804-237-8585. You’ll get my recommended home value opinion at no charge.

I just need a quick phone call with you to learn more about your home, along with any photos or videos you can send me (very important) by email, text, FB Messenger, etc. You’ll have a better idea of what a bank may value your home for a refinance, you can update your balance sheet, or you can just rest assured knowing what a buyer would likely pay today. 

Just last month, we worked with two families whose homes sold for 8% and 14% over the list price. You can imagine how pleased these clients were!

Interest rates are at record lows after the Federal Reserve lowered their lending rate and bank reserve requirements. This keeps home prices high since money is cheap for borrowers. 

History shows this amazing trend won’t go on forever. If you’re thinking about selling your home, this summer/fall may be your best chance to land your highest selling price.

I’m here to help with any real estate needs you have. Let me know if you have any questions. I’ll give you a well-researched and accurate answer so you can make the right decisions.

Our real estate market is red-hot for sellers right now.

Now, I’m not big on predictions when it comes to the real estate market, but I am big on giving you statistical data directly from our Richmond Metro MLS so you know what’s specifically happening right now. The three things you need to know before you get ready to sell are:

1. Average days on market. Right now, that number is 28 days in Richmond.

2. Average list-to-sale-price ratio. This is 100% right now, meaning that sellers are getting full price for their homes.

3. Inventory. We have only 1.3 months right now. To give you some perspective, a seller’s market is anything under six months and a buyer’s market is anything over six months. With just 1.3 months, we have an extreme seller’s market.

“I’ve never seen a market like this before.”

This checks out when it comes to what we’ve been experiencing with our clients. We’re working with one seller right now who got an offer that was 15% above asking price. Another seller got a sight-unseen cash offer of 8% over their list price. It’s a crazy market, and I’ve never seen anything like this in 21 years in the business.

If you’re even entertaining the idea of selling your home right now, I would love to give you some advice on how to proceed. Just give me a call or send me an email today with any questions you might have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I’m digital door knocking to find homes for some of my buyers.

Today I wanted to share a new opportunity with you that I call “Digital Door Knocking.” As I’m sure many of you are aware, we are experiencing a shortage of inventory in the market right now. In other words, there are not a lot of homes for sale.

I’m doing things a little bit differently by telling you about some of the buyers we are currently working with and what they are specifically looking for.

First, we have this awesome couple with two kids who are looking in the Freeman school district. They want a home with four bedrooms, under $400,000, and most importantly, an in-law suite. 

Next, we have another couple who are first-time homebuyers with one child. They’re looking for a home in the Bellevue and/or Lakeside area with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and under $350,000.

“If your home fits any of these descriptions, I want to buy your house.”

Another couple we’re working with are empty nesters who are moving back to Richmond. Location is not as important to them as the home. They’re looking for a contemporary house, and their budget is $1 million.

Finally, we have an amazing family of four who are looking for a home with five acres or more in the Louisa, Goochland, Hanover area. They need to have a basement and their budget is under $500,000.

If you’re a homeowner, have you ever had anybody knock on your door and say, “Hey, I want to buy your house?” Well, guess what? That’s what I’m doing right now. If your home fits any of the descriptions above, you need to give me a call today because I have a buyer for your house. 

If you have further questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.

        <description>

These lessons from my father shaped my view of the world.

Last month, we shared fond memories of our dads as a Father’s Day tribute. It got me thinking about the many lessons my father taught me that have shaped the person I am today. I wanted to share a few of my favorite lessons that I refer back to frequently. You may have heard these very same things from your father, mother, or mentor, or perhaps they will stir up other classic ‘dad phrases,’ which I hope bring a smile to your face.

1. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing right. When I was a young man, my father was a flooring contractor and used to bring me to work during summer break. He asked me to prep the floor so that he could lay the flooring when I was done. When I was finished, I went up to him and told him the floor was ready. However, he brought me back over to the floor and pointed out some dust that I had left behind. He told me that because I left the dust there, the glue wouldn’t stick and the floor would eventually come up. He proceeded to show me how to sweep the floor correctly. 

“I love my dad for giving me the gift of being able to live my life without fear.”

2. Always be teaching. My father was incredibly gifted with his hands. He worked on cars, lawnmowers, the house, and anything else he could get his hands on. He always brought me, my brother, and my sister along, too. As an adult, when I’m working with someone who’s never used a specific tool, I realize that it takes 10 times longer to show them how to do it rather than just doing it yourself. I have so much more respect for my father now because he was showing us how to do these things without hesitation when we were with him.

3. There’s nothing you can break that I can’t fix. I remember when I was about 20 years old, my father owned an excavating business and a piece of equipment called a backhoe. The problem with using this machine is that, in tight corners, the backhoe will hit things. He came up to me and let me know that I need to be cognizant of making tight turns if I want to avoid causing damage. Then he uttered these words: Son, there is nothing you can break that I can’t fix. He was basically telling me that it was OK to fail, and these words have shaped the lives of me and my siblings. I will never, ever forget that lesson, and I love my dad for giving me the gift of being able to live my life without fear attached to it.

I hold all three of these lessons with me every single day, and they have shaped my life in unimaginable ways. I’m glad to be able to pass them along here.

If you have any questions or real estate needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I would love to hear from you.

Here’s how we help our clients who need to buy and sell simultaneously.

I get this question a lot: “Mark, we want to buy a house, but we have to sell our current home first. We don’t want to risk carrying two mortgages, so how is this possible? The idea of an extra monthly payment is scary, but we have a solid strategy we’ve been using for years to ensure you don’t get caught in this financial bind. Check out this short video to see how we minimize the risk of buying and selling at the same time and give you the confidence to achieve your real estate goals. 

If you have questions about how we can help you buy a home, sell a home, or both at once, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Now is a great time to stop renting and become a homeowner. Here’s why.

When you own a home, you enjoy certain advantages that renters don’t get. Here are the top five reasons to buy your own home instead of renting:

1. You can make changes to the property. This could include changing the paint color, adding a big garden, and other projects that you just can’t do in a rental property.

2. You can write off interest annually. When you make your monthly payment on your mortgage, a portion of that goes toward interest, and you get to write that interest off on an annual basis.

4. Home equity. When you make your payment each month, you’re decreasing the life of the loan. The gap between how much you still owe and the value of your property is called equity, which can be used for multiple purposes.

5. Small business write-offs. If you own a small business and you’re using your home to operate that business, you get to write a portion of it off, which is especially nice given our current environment.

If you have any questions about this information or I can help you in any way, feel free to reach out to me.

These numbers show our market is a strong sellers’ market.

I’ve been getting a lot of questions about property values and recent home sale numbers. Today I want to address both topics with some hard data. For example, the median sale price in April 2019 was $259,000. This April, the median price was $271,538. People are still buying and selling homes right now. We’re taking every precaution to make sure all of our clients remain safe and healthy throughout the process. To learn more, watch the short video above.

Back before social distancing, my team got together to celebrate National Pizza Party Week. Check out our party in the video above!

One thing I love most about Superstars Pizza is that you can get pizza by the slice to customize your own bite instead of having to compromise with the rest of your family. When our team got together for our pizza party, we ordered eight equally delicious slices of all different types. We also dished out our individual pizza-eating quirks, and even tried a new approach to savoring a slice. We hope you get a kick out of our conversation!

I’m sharing our latest real estate market statistics.

Yes, we’re all stuck at home, but happy spring anyway! For the last few weeks, everyone has been asking what’s going on in our real estate market and where it’s heading. Many people are getting their information online or through the news, but the info we’re sharing comes directly from our Multiple Listing Service (MLS). As of the recording of this video, in the last three days, there were 209 new listings on the marketplace, 214 homes actually went under contract, and 141 closed. So right now, we’re in a seller’s market. To learn more about our market, watch the short video above.

Here’s a light-hearted look at how I’m keeping my real estate business moving in these unusual times.

Everyone on the team is adjusting to our new work-at-home routines, including the pets. Today, instead of offering market statistics or future projections, I thought I’d share something on a lighter note. I’m giving you exclusive access into my new typical day at the office! Some of my morning rituals remain the same, but the commute sure looks different… Hope this leaves you smiling! 

If you have any questions about real estate, you know where to find me—at home, still working hard for our clients! Reach out by phone or email and I’d be happy to address your needs. Until then, stay safe, and make the most out of today!

Hi there, Mark Adams here. I hope you and your family are staying well. I wanted to address the questions I’ve been getting lately regarding our current market.

“Mark, what’s really going on in the marketplace right now? Is now a good time to sell my house, or should we wait?

I’ve been in the business for 21 years now, and pushed through several market crises. We thrive during times like this because of the sturdy relationships we’ve built with lenders, attorneys, movers, and other service providers. We are prepared to continue serving you in the same capacity we always have.

“It’s still a seller’s market, but the interest rates will save you tons of money.”

The bottom line is, it’s still a seller’s market, and due to the low inventory, those that do put their house on the market are going to have less competition.

As far as buyers are concerned: yes, there is less inventory to choose from, BUT the interest rates are so attractive right now, so when you do find your dream home, it’s going to save you tons of money.

If you have any questions about your property or the buying/selling process, please do not hesitate to reach out. We are here for you, and ready to help in any way we can. Stay safe, and we look forward to serving you.

March 14 is National Pi(e) Day and National Chip Day. Today we’re celebrating in advance.

Did you know that March 14 is National Potato Chip Day? In honor of the occasion, I wanted to get together with my team to discuss some of our favorite salty, crispy, and crunchy treats.

My favorite are the classic potato sticks. They’re crispy, salty, and delicious.

Chloe’s are Pringles, which bring back fond memories of her mom sending her care packages filled with Pringles every summer at camp.

“What’s your favorite chip?”

Lisa brought Andy Capp Hot Fries, which she wasn’t introduced to until she met me. In addition to being crunchy and crispy, they add a little bit of spice.

Amy brought a local treat, Mama Saba’s Pita Chips. They are a scrumptious, slightly healthier alternative to potato chips. She also brought Dorito’s, which she used to put on a sandwich with mayo and country ham when she was younger and in school.

March 14 is also National Pi(e) Day, and I got a close-up view of one at 3:30 in the video above.

What’s your favorite chip? What’s your favorite pi(e)? Let us know in the comments. If you have any questions for us in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.

Here&rsquo;s some essential information to know if you&rsquo;ve considered buying a new construction property.

 

Amy “The Miracle Maker” Baker splits her time between the resale market and new construction. Since inventory is pretty slim, many are turning to new construction right now. Today she joins me to discuss why you need an experienced agent like her to help you navigate the new construction process.

What are the differences between buying new construction and resale homes?

In a new construction home, you get to choose the design, layout, and finishes that come in that home. With a resale home, you’re inheriting someone else’s home, including their landscaping and neighborhood.

What are the pros and cons of buying new construction?

The timeline for new construction can definitely be a downside; Amy has seen many delays in recent months, sometimes as long as three months!

“If you sign your name into a builder’s registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.”

 What’s the difference between a production builder and a custom builder?

Production builders are cost-conscious; they’ll provide you with a few lot selections, floor plans, and finish packages to choose between. This keeps prices down and buyers from getting overwhelmed by all the options they have.

Custom builders give you a lot more choice over how the house is designed like your flooring, paint colors, trim, hardware, etc., so they involve a bigger time commitment.

What do people need to know about new construction purchases?

When buyers walk into a new construction site, there’s usually a salesperson or site agent there. That agent represents the builder, not you, meaning that if you write that person an offer on the new construction home, they’ll be negotiating for the builder and against you. So if you sign your name into their registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.

That’s why you need to give agents like Amy a call before you begin shopping for homes; she’ll represent your best interests from the beginning to the end of the process.

If you have any questions about new construction, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’re happy to stand in your corner to help you achieve your goals.

        <description>

What do women really want on Valentine’s Day? I brought together my favorite group of ladies: my team, Amy, Lisa, and Chloe. I’m going to ask them some questions, and their answers may enlighten you about what women want. 

Do your Valentine’s Day desires fall more in line with Hallmark or HGTV?


  Chloe: Is the food network an option? As long as he’s cooking for me.
  Amy: I like a little romance, but I also like projects. So I would want a pot for cooking, chocolates, perfume, or jewelry. 
  Lisa: For me it’s HGTV; I want those projects done. Make me something pretty.


“I brought together a group of my most favorite ladies in the world: my team.”

What’s the last thing you’d ever want on Valentine’s Day?


  Chloe: I do not want another singing card!
  Amy: Don’t buy me golf clubs; you can get me lessons, but not the actual clubs.
  Lisa: No fishing pole. I don’t want to go fishing, talk about fishing, or shop for fishing lures. 


What’s the perfect Valentine’s Day gift?


  Lisa: Something with whiskers… meow. 
  Chloe: I second that, but also pizza and champagne. 
  Lisa: Or a day trip. Even just shopping and lunch in another town nearby would be great.
  Amy: My family wants another puppy, so that would be the perfect family gift. I would also be happy to cook dinner for everyone.


I want to thank my favorite ladies for gathering to share their thoughts about Valentine’s Day. I hope you learned something, I know I did. Have a happy Valentine’s Day!

What if a fire destroyed your home? What if most of the damaged areas are unrecognizable? How would you prove what personal property was lost? I hope this never happens to you, but I’m sharing some tips for how to create a digital home inventory in case of any disastrous events. 

Theft, fire, and flooding can happen to homeowners. Do you know what you would need to provide to the insurance company to get those items replaced? 

First, using your phone or video camera, walk through your home and videotape each room, including every wall. This way you can show an insurance adjuster what your home looked like before the claim. Then take pictures of electronics, (front and back) with the serial numbers in clear view. Take photos of the appraisals for jewelry, silver, expensive eyeglasses, artwork, tools, and any valuable collectibles.

Remember: Anytime you bring home a new laptop, computer, or anything of value, be sure to snap a photo of the serial number right on the box. Keeping the receipt is a great idea, too. 

Lastly, upload your digital photo album to your online storage service. We use Dropbox, but you could use any photo storage site. Google Photos, iCloud, and Photobucket are common choices. Don’t use Facebook, as we don’t want to give burglars any ideas. 

Don’t forget to add photos to your digital home inventory each time you make a new, inventory-worthy purchase. The more information you provide to the insurance adjuster about a specific item, the better your chances to get it replaced with an item of the same value. Also, while you’re taking photos of your property, make sure to take one of the most valuable things of all: your pet! 

If you have further questions about  digital home inventories or real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would love to help you.

        <description>

Happy New Year! I hope the new year is starting out wonderfully for you. You know about New Year’s resolutions, but have you ever considered including your home in them? 

At the beginning of the year, my wife and I make a list of all the things we want to accomplish in or on our house that year. Everything from larger projects like adding a porch, to smaller things like painting a room. Typically, your home is the single largest investment you’ll make. Maintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell. 

I receive calls from people frequently asking what’s the best improvement someone can make to get the highest return on investment. Generally, it’s kitchen and bathroom improvements. At the same time, not all investments will bring the same return. A fence, patio, or a shed, for example, are “use” items, which means you get to use them, but you don’t necessarily get a full return on that investment.

“Maintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell.”

Here’s what I recommend: Once you decide which projects you want to do, write them down. Make sure this list is in a place where you’ll see it regularly. When you see this list on a regular basis, you’ll be more inclined to get those projects done. Also, studies show that writing something down helps you remember it better. 

If you’re concerned about which projects you should do, give me a call or send me an email, I’d be glad to share which project will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Have a fantastic 2020!

        <title>What Is NFM Lending?</title>

        <description>

Today I’m here with Greg Cowart from NFM Lending to help me answer some questions I’ve received lately about mortgage lenders and loan products in the market. But first, what’s so special about NFM Lending?

Greg says, “What makes NFM Lending different from other mortgage companies is that we’re local; I’ve been doing mortgages in Richmond for 18 years. We focus on the purchase process, so we assist people who are buying homes. About 95% of what we do is walking someone through the process of buying a home and all the hurdles that commonly come up. So, when people choose us they’re choosing our experience, we work with a team. They’re choosing the fact that the team is going to give wonderful service all the way through, and they’re also choosing a smaller mortgage model, which allows for greater control and superior results.”

“When searching for the right mortgage lender, when you go with a well-known brand name, you’re also often getting things you don’t want such as bureaucracy, slowness, excuses, and excessive rules. NFM Lending is where a lot of experienced loan officers are going because they allow us to run our branch our way. I have the autonomy to create systems, to hire, to market myself, and create an experience that I wouldn’t get if I worked for one of the big brand name banks.”

“About 95% of what we do is walking someone through the process of buying a home.”

One of the things I appreciate most about Greg is that if a client comes to him and he can’t service them in the correct product, he’ll point them in another direction. 

Another question we get often is, “Are online mortgages something people should consider?”

According to Greg, “Online is an option, we’re seeing many industries moving in that direction. Most mortgages are five to six loan programs. They’re fairly standard from company to company. One of the things you’re accepting when you choose an online lender is their distance. You’re choosing someone who isn’t face-to-face, so you cannot as easily get ahold of them if something happens. Therefore, there’s a bit more lack of accountability. I generally find that the internet lenders don’t have as much experience, and they are also a lot more of a bureaucratic process, where the person you initially talk to may not be the one you work with all the way through. 

“Rocket Mortgage is a brand you may have heard of. They’re one of the first lenders to move heavily into a national online presence and buy heaps of advertising. It’s the same product we offer, it’s just going through an online platform, it’s more of a call center experience. We have the same computer systems, the same easy application process, we just haven’t marketed ourselves that way. At the end of the day they’re in Arizona and Cleveland, they’re not local to your community, Realtor, or client.”

If you have any other questions about NFM Lending or anything else concerning real estate, please reach out to me via phone or email, I would love to help you.

        <title>3 Reasons to List During the Holidays</title>

I want to share three advantages to listing your home during the holidays:

1. Low inventory. During this time of the year, inventory is especially low, and there are not many admirable homes on the market. Most people wait until the beginning of the year to list their home, so there’s less competition. 

2. Motivated buyers. We don’t have any “window shoppers” out right now—we have buyers.

“During this time of the year, inventory is especially low.”

3. Home presentation. Your home never looks as nice as it does during the holidays. For example, my wife enjoys getting out the holiday decorations and making the house look incredible.

If you’re thinking about selling your house, don’t hesitate to give me a call. I’d be glad to come by and see if it makes sense for you to list your home during the holidays. If you have any questions feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help you in any way I can!

Here’s the thing: I could go on and on about how wonderful our team is, but I’d rather share what some of our past clients have said about us:

Joey and Oliver said, “The team really treats you like family. They are so efficient and very helpful. They’ll take the stress away from buying or selling your home.”

Adeet said, “Amy Baker made sure the deal went smoothly despite some unexpected turns along the way. She was able to refer me to great people in our local area to help out with all aspects of the deal after closing.”

Cindy said, “Mark and his team are incredible. No one likes the process of selling their home, but they made it as painless as possible. They gave me a list of things to do they thought would make my house more attractive to buyers. There was no pressure, and my house sold over asking price in one weekend.”

“Everyone on our team has a passion for helping and serving others.”

George and Nancy said, “They did so much more than sell the house—we never expected the process to be so fast and painless.”

These were just a few people we’ve had the pleasure of serving over the last 20 years. Everyone on our team has a passion for helping and serving others.

If you have any questions about buying, selling, or anything to do with real estate, reach out to us. It truly would be our pleasure to serve you in any way that we can.

        <description>

Many sellers are wondering whether 2019 may be the best time to list their homes, and the truth is that it very well may be. Homes are selling quickly and for top dollar—with homes in good condition often earning more than asking price. 

This is partially thanks to our interest rates, which, after dropping significantly since last year, have made buyers extremely eager to make a move.

However, these conditions won’t last forever. Home prices have been steadily on the rise since 2012, and they’re going to have to stabilize sometime. Experts say that time is drawing near. 

“We can’t be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.”

The bottom line is that now is the time to act. We can’t be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike. 

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to learn more about how I can help you take advantage of today’s market conditions, please give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
