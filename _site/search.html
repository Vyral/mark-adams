        "content": "Friends and Clients âThe real estate market continues to surge ahead. However, clouds might be forming on the horizon for sellers. Let me give you the details:1. Ultra-low mortgage ratesThroughout 2020, the popular 30-year fixed mortgage rate set 15 new record lows.Â It ended 2020 just one basis point higher than the latest record low and currently stands at 2.86%, a full percentage point lower than one year ago.These ultra-low mortgage rates are driving an increase in demand. Unfortunately, sales are restricted due toâ¦2. Record-low inventoryThere were just 1.28 million homes available for sale at the end of November, the last month for which we have full data.That is down 22% from a year earlier. It is also the lowest inventory count since the National Association of Realtors began tracking this metric in 1982.Unsurprisingly, home prices are shooting up thanks to strong demand and record low inventory.The median price of an existing home sold in November was a staggering 14.6% higher than in November 2019.If youâre worried this pace is unsustainable, you might be right:3. A change in the market?Some experts warn that home prices are overheating and that affordability is suffering.They might have a point because, after five consecutive months of gains, closed sales of existing homes lowered in November.Â Similarly, after three straight months of record highs, homebuilder confidence in December dropped 4%. December mortgage applications also fell.Â So what does this all mean for you?Well, things might get harder soon for home sellers.Lower affordability could hurt demand, and the price growth weâve seen over the past months might slow down, or prices might decrease like we started to see before the pandemic.Fortunately, nationwide trends havenât caught up to us yet in Richmond.Demand is still very strong. If you were to list now, you could sell quickly and at top dollar.If youâd like to get an idea of what your home is worth right now, you can use the following home value calculator, which is based on recent Richmond sales:Enter your address here to find out what your home is currently worthIf you are considering selling while the current market lasts, give me a call at 804.237.8585. Iâve helped many people sell in these pandemic circumstances, and Iâm here to answer your questions and help however I can.If you have a friend or family member thinking about selling it would be my pleasure to earn their business. Donât hesitate to call me and I promise to take great care of them. Â Have a great day,Mark Adams",

        "content": "You may not be superstitious, but weâre at least a little âstitious!We got together as a team to celebrate another successful year in business, in spite of all the curveballs 2020 threw our way. Although it was a great year for many reasons, you might be as happy as we are to say âgood riddance!â to 2020. As our mindsets shift toward 2021, we want to bring about all the good fortune possible, so we reminisced on some superstitions from our childhoods. We figure that 2021 may need as many of these good-luck charms and superstitions as it can get, so we went ahead and performed a whole mess of them!To start, Markâs mom always prepared black-eyed peas to eat on New Yearâs to bring good luck. He also eats an apple every day to keep the doctor away (would you call that luck or science?).  Also, picking up pennies is something he still does to this day.Chloe also recalls tossing pennies into a fountain as a kid for good luck, and on the first day of every month, she recites the words âbunny, bunny, bunnyââa twist on the classic ârabbit, rabbit, rabbitâ superstition.âPeople in Spain toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass, symbolizing 12 months of good luck for the new year.âRabbits are also a part of Amyâs good luck traditions. She carries a rabbitâs foot to rub for good luck, with much success; itâs brought about some clutch UVA basketball wins and even a surprise baby!Lisa has a horseshoe from her grandfather that symbolizes luck, and tosses salt over her shoulder. She also knocks on wood, which is something you might do all the time, too, but do you know why? In Irish folklore, evil spirits live in the wood, so you must knock on it to deafen their ears to your wishes.Lastly, we all decided to cheers to the new year. As it turns out, Spaniards toast at midnight with 12 grapes in their glass; each one is to be eaten to symbolize 12 months of good luck in the upcoming year.Hereâs to your good fortune in 2021! If we can help you with that, at least by way of your real estate needs, please donât hesitate to reach out. Happy holidays to you and yours, and adios, 2020!",

She joined us to answer some questions about deterring crime during the holiday season. Curious what you could take away from her message? Check out our brief interview in the video above to learn some great tips on protecting your deliveries from âporch pirates,â as well as protecting yourself, your home, and your vehicle.If youâre just looking for quick tips to snatch ân grab, here are the highlights:      Leave special instructions for delivery drivers for where to place your packages; ask that they hide them behind outdoor furniture or leave them at a side door where they are less visible.        Keep all of your doors/windows locked at all times!Â         Donât leave valuables (shopping bags, presents, etc.) in your car. Take them inside.        Leave your lights on, especially your outdoor lights. Sure, it might run up your electric bill, but on the plus side, Santa will have no problem finding your house!

She has also gotten to enjoy decorating her new home in Wintergreen. Her children have been very productive in making ornaments for their Christmas tree at the mountain house. These talented kiddos need their own Etsy account!Chloe is grateful for many things that came from quarantine. Sheâs gotten to fulfill her dream of being a stay-at-home mom while also having a jobâthe best of both worlds. Sheâs also thankful for all the educators who have taken an impossible situation and made the best of it. Although homeschooling is challenging, she is glad to have a more active role in Joieâs education.âWe hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.âFall is Lisaâs favorite time of the year, and is grateful that sheâs had the opportunity to spend lots of time with her animals in 2020. Sheâs thankful for her health and the ability to work from home with her husband (thanks to noise-canceling headphones). She was also given an unusual blessing in the fact that her brother and his family were able to spend more time with their mother, who passed away recently. The hospital allowed his whole family to be there with her, which isnât typical these days. Also, Lisa is grateful for being able to spend time with friends over Zoom, take walks, and settle into a good book.As for me, Iâm thankful for my friends and family members. This time in quarantine has also given me an opportunity to not only spend more time at home, but also to enjoy the amazing garden my wife created where sheâs grown some impressive pumpkins! One of the most critical lessons weâve learned during quarantine is how important it is to be around people. Our team has missed meeting in person on a regular basis, so we really appreciate this time weâve had together today.Last, but not least, weâre all thankful for you!Â Weâre so grateful for being able to serve such amazing people like yourselves.Â We hope that you and yours have a truly happy Thanksgiving.What are you thankful for this year?

        "content": "Given the market, should you stay in your home and refinance or just sell it?Should you stay in your current house and refinance or should you prepare to sell it because the market is so attractive for sellers right now?Â There are a couple of questions youâll need to ask yourself before you can make this decision:  How long will I stay in the area?Â   What does it cost to refinance?Once you have the answers to those questions, choosing which path is right for you should be a little easier.Now letâs talk about the refinancing process. A good rule of thumb is that if you can get a good interest rate thatâs 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance. Typically, there are fees associated with refinancing. To find out what those fees are, just ask your mortgage company for a good faith estimate. That will have a list of all the fees associated with refinancing.âIf you can get a good interest rate thatâs 1% lower than your current interest rate, it might make sense to refinance.âSuppose that itâs going to cost $2,000 to refinance your house. In this scenario, youâll get a 1% reduction in your interest rate, so youâd save $100 a month on your mortgage if you do refinance. In this case, it would take you 20 months to pay off the $2,000 investment. Ask yourself if it makes sense to even invest your money right now if itâll take that long to recoup. It might make more sense to use that money to fix your house up so that when you get ready to sell in two or three years, youâll get top dollar for it. It just depends on your situation.If youâre still not sure about which path is right for you, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to share my advice about what exactly you can do to your house to get the biggest bang for your buck. I can also give you guidance about whether it makes sense to refinance your house instead. Itâs my pleasure to help you.",

Call me at 804-237-8585. Youâll get my recommended home value opinion at no charge.I just need a quick phone call with you to learn more about your home, along with any photos or videos you can send me (very important) by email, text, FB Messenger, etc. Youâll have a better idea of what a bank may value your home for a refinance, you can update your balance sheet, or you can just rest assured knowing what a buyer would likely pay today.Â Just last month, we worked with two families whose homes sold for 8% and 14% over the list price. You can imagine how pleased these clients were!Interest rates are at record lows after the Federal Reserve lowered their lending rate and bank reserve requirements. This keeps home prices high since money is cheap for borrowers.Â History shows this amazing trend wonât go on forever.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "These lessons from my father shaped my view of the world.Last month, we shared fond memories of our dads as a Fatherâs Day tribute. It got me thinking about the many lessons my father taught me that have shaped the person I am today. I wanted to share a few of my favorite lessons that I refer back to frequently. You may have heard these very same things from your father, mother, or mentor, or perhaps they will stir up other classic âdad phrases,â which I hope bring a smile to your face.1. If itâs worth doing, itâs worth doing right. When I was a young man, my father was a flooring contractor and used to bring me to work during summer break. He asked me to prep the floor so that he could lay the flooring when I was done. When I was finished, I went up to him and told him the floor was ready. However, he brought me back over to the floor and pointed out some dust that I had left behind. He told me that because I left the dust there, the glue wouldnât stick and the floor would eventually come up. He proceeded to show me how to sweep the floor correctly.Â âI love my dad for giving me the gift of being able to live my life without fear.â2. Always be teaching. My father was incredibly gifted with his hands. He worked on cars, lawnmowers, the house, and anything else he could get his hands on. He always brought me, my brother, and my sister along, too. As an adult, when Iâm working with someone whoâs never used a specific tool, I realize that it takes 10 times longer to show them how to do it rather than just doing it yourself. I have so much more respect for my father now because he was showing us how to do these things without hesitation when we were with him.3. Thereâs nothing you can break that I canât fix. I remember when I was about 20 years old, my father owned an excavating business and a piece of equipment called a backhoe. The problem with using this machine is that, in tight corners, the backhoe will hit things. He came up to me and let me know that I need to be cognizant of making tight turns if I want to avoid causing damage. Then he uttered these words: Son, there is nothing you can break that I canât fix. He was basically telling me that it was OK to fail, and these words have shaped the lives of me and my siblings. I will never, ever forget that lesson, and I love my dad for giving me the gift of being able to live my life without fear attached to it.I hold all three of these lessons with me every single day, and they have shaped my life in unimaginable ways. Iâm glad to be able to pass them along here.If you have any questions or real estate needs that I can assist with, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email today.

        "content": "Now is a great time to stop renting and become a homeowner. Hereâs why.When you own a home, you enjoy certain advantages that renters donât get. Here are the top five reasons to buy your own home instead of renting:1. You can make changes to the property. This could include changing the paint color, adding a big garden, and other projects that you just canât do in a rental property.2. You can write off interest annually. When you make your monthly payment on your mortgage, a portion of that goes toward interest, and you get to write that interest off on an annual basis.4. Home equity. When you make your payment each month, youâre decreasing the life of the loan. The gap between how much you still owe and the value of your property is called equity, which can be used for multiple purposes.5. Small business write-offs. If you own a small business and youâre using your home to operate that business, you get to write a portion of it off, which is especially nice given our current environment.If you have any questions about this information or I can help you in any way, feel free to reach out to me.",

Since inventory is pretty slim, many are turning to new construction right now. Today she joins me to discuss why you need an experienced agent like her to help you navigate the new construction process.What are the differences between buying new construction and resale homes?In a new construction home, you get to choose the design, layout, and finishes that come in that home. With a resale home, youâre inheriting someone elseâs home, including their landscaping and neighborhood.What are the pros and cons of buying new construction?The timeline for new construction can definitely be a downside; Amy has seen many delays in recent months, sometimes as long as three months!âIf you sign your name into a builderâs registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.âÂ Whatâs the difference between a production builder and a custom builder?Production builders are cost-conscious; theyâll provide you with a few lot selections, floor plans, and finish packages to choose between. This keeps prices down and buyers from getting overwhelmed by all the options they have.Custom builders give you a lot more choice over how the house is designed like your flooring, paint colors, trim, hardware, etc., so they involve a bigger time commitment.What do people need to know about new construction purchases?When buyers walk into a new construction site, thereâs usually a salesperson or site agent there. That agent represents the builder, not you, meaning that if you write that person an offer on the new construction home, theyâll be negotiating for the builder and against you. So if you sign your name into their registry without including the name of an agent, you give up all representation.Thatâs why you need to give agents like Amy a call before you begin shopping for homes; sheâll represent your best interests from the beginning to the end of the process.If you have any questions about new construction, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

Make me something pretty.âI brought together a group of my most favorite ladies in the world: my team.âWhatâs the last thing youâd ever want on Valentineâs Day?  Chloe: I do not want another singing card!  Amy: Donât buy me golf clubs; you can get me lessons, but not the actual clubs.  Lisa: No fishing pole. I donât want to go fishing, talk about fishing, or shop for fishing lures.Â Whatâs the perfect Valentineâs Day gift?  Lisa: Something with whiskersâ¦ meow.Â   Chloe: I second that, but also pizza and champagne.Â   Lisa: Or a day trip. Even just shopping and lunch in another town nearby would be great.  Amy: My family wants another puppy, so that would be the perfect family gift. I would also be happy to cook dinner for everyone.I want to thank my favorite ladies for gathering to share their thoughts about Valentineâs Day. I hope you learned something, I know I did.

        "content": "What if a fire destroyed your home? What if most of the damaged areas are unrecognizable? How would you prove what personal property was lost? I hope this never happens to you, but Iâm sharing some tips for how to create a digital home inventory in case of any disastrous events.Â Theft, fire, and flooding can happen to homeowners. Do you know what you would need to provide to the insurance company to get those items replaced?Â First, using your phone or video camera, walk through your home and videotape each room, including every wall. This way you can show an insurance adjuster what your home looked like before the claim. Then take pictures of electronics, (front and back) with the serial numbers in clear view. Take photos of the appraisals for jewelry, silver, expensive eyeglasses, artwork, tools, and any valuable collectibles.Remember: Anytime you bring home a new laptop, computer, or anything of value, be sure to snap a photo of the serial number right on the box. Keeping the receipt is a great idea, too.Â Lastly, upload your digital photo album to your online storage service. We use Dropbox, but you could use any photo storage site. Google Photos, iCloud, and Photobucket are common choices. Donât use Facebook, as we donât want to give burglars any ideas.Â Donât forget to add photos to your digital home inventory each time you make a new, inventory-worthy purchase. The more information you provide to the insurance adjuster about a specific item, the better your chances to get it replaced with an item of the same value. Also, while youâre taking photos of your property, make sure to take one of the most valuable things of all: your pet!Â If you have further questions about Â digital home inventories or real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email.

        "content": "Happy New Year! I hope the new year is starting out wonderfully for you. You know about New Yearâs resolutions, but have you ever considered including your home in them?Â At the beginning of the year, my wife and I make a list of all the things we want to accomplish in or on our house that year. Everything from larger projects like adding a porch, to smaller things like painting a room. Typically, your home is the single largest investment youâll make. Maintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell.Â I receive calls from people frequently asking whatâs the best improvement someone can make to get the highest return on investment. Generally, itâs kitchen and bathroom improvements. At the same time, not all investments will bring the same return. A fence, patio, or a shed, for example, are âuseâ items, which means you get to use them, but you donât necessarily get a full return on that investment.âMaintaining your home truly helps you get an exceptional return when it comes time to sell.âHereâs what I recommend: Once you decide which projects you want to do, write them down. Make sure this list is in a place where youâll see it regularly. When you see this list on a regular basis, youâll be more inclined to get those projects done. Also, studies show that writing something down helps you remember it better.Â If youâre concerned about which projects you should do, give me a call or send me an email, Iâd be glad to share which project will give you the biggest bang for your buck.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today Iâm here with Greg Cowart from NFM Lending to help me answer some questions Iâve received lately about mortgage lenders and loan products in the market. But first, whatâs so special about NFM Lending?Greg says, âWhat makes NFM Lending different from other mortgage companies is that weâre local;Â Iâve been doing mortgages in Richmond for 18 years. We focus on the purchase process, so we assist people who are buying homes. About 95% of what we do is walking someone through the process of buying a home and all the hurdles that commonly come up. So, when people choose us theyâre choosing our experience, we work with a team. Theyâre choosing the fact that the team is going to give wonderful service all the way through, and theyâre also choosing a smaller mortgage model, which allows for greater control and superior results.ââWhen searching for the right mortgage lender, when you go with a well-known brand name, youâre also often getting things you donât want such as bureaucracy, slowness, excuses, and excessive rules. NFM Lending is where a lot of experienced loan officers are going because they allow us to run our branch our way. I have the autonomy to create systems, to hire, to market myself, and create an experience that I wouldnât get if I worked for one of the big brand name banks.ââAbout 95% of what we do is walking someone through the process of buying a home.âOne of the things I appreciate most about Greg is that if a client comes to him and he canât service them in the correct product, heâll point them in another direction.Â Another question we get often is, âAre online mortgages something people should consider?âAccording to Greg, âOnline is an option, weâre seeing many industries moving in that direction. Most mortgages are five to six loan programs. Theyâre fairly standard from company to company. One of the things youâre accepting when you choose an online lender is their distance. Youâre choosing someone who isnât face-to-face, so you cannot as easily get ahold of them if something happens. Therefore, thereâs a bit more lack of accountability. I generally find that the internet lenders donât have as much experience, and they are also a lot more of a bureaucratic process, where the person you initially talk to may not be the one you work with all the way through.Â âRocket Mortgage is a brand you may have heard of. Theyâre one of the first lenders to move heavily into a national online presence and buy heaps of advertising. Itâs the same product we offer, itâs just going through an online platform, itâs more of a call center experience. We have the same computer systems, the same easy application process, we just havenât marketed ourselves that way. At the end of the day theyâre in Arizona and Cleveland, theyâre not local to your community, Realtor, or client.âIf you have any other questions about NFM Lending or anything else concerning real estate, please reach out to me via phone or email, I would love to help you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "I want to share three advantages to listing your home during the holidays:1. Low inventory. During this time of the year, inventory is especially low, and there are not many admirable homes on the market. Most people wait until the beginning of the year to list their home, so thereâs less competition.Â 2. Motivated buyers. We donât have any âwindow shoppersâ out right nowâwe have buyers.âDuring this time of the year, inventory is especially low.â3. Home presentation. Your home never looks as nice as it does during the holidays. For example, my wife enjoys getting out the holiday decorations and making the house look incredible.If youâre thinking about selling your house, donât hesitate to give me a call. Iâd be glad to come by and see if it makes sense for you to list your home during the holidays. If you have any questions feel free to call or email me.

No one likes the process of selling their home, but they made it as painless as possible. They gave me a list of things to do they thought would make my house more attractive to buyers. There was no pressure, and my house sold over asking price in one weekend.ââEveryone on our team has a passion for helping and serving others.âGeorge and Nancy said, âThey did so much more than sell the houseâwe never expected the process to be so fast and painless.âThese were just a few people weâve had the pleasure of serving over the last 20 years.

        "content": "Many sellers are wondering whether 2019 may be the best time to list their homes, and the truth is that it very well may be. Homes are selling quickly and for top dollarâwith homes in good condition often earning more than asking price.Â This is partially thanks to our interest rates, which, after dropping significantly since last year, have made buyers extremely eager to make a move.However, these conditions wonât last forever. Home prices have been steadily on the rise since 2012, and theyâre going to have to stabilize sometime. Experts say that time is drawing near.Â âWe canât be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.âThe bottom line is that now is the time to act. We canât be sure when the market adjustment will hit Richmond, but we can be sure that our current market holds great opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.Â If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to learn more about how I can help you take advantage of todayâs market conditions, please give me a call or send me an email.
